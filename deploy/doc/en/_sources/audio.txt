Audio System
************

Audio sources are created in Blender. The standard "Speaker" object is
used.

Audio Source Settings
=====================

Speaker parameters can be set up on the "Properties" panel under the
"Object Data" tab.

The engine supports all the standard Blender sound parameters and some
engine-specific settings.

*Speaker behavior*:

   The behavior of the audio source.

   "Positional" --- high-quality sound with spatial positioning and
   directivity (conicity). The Web Audio API is used for sound
   rendering. Playback performance of such sounds is the least and so
   use them only for short samples.

   "Background Sound" --- high-quality omnidirectional sound without
   spatial positioning. The Web Audio API is used for sound rendering.
   It is more performant but is not effective for music.

   "Background Music" --- used for music playback. It has maximum
   performance due to the use of the Audio HTML tag, but has minimum
   flexibility.

The following options are available on the "Sound" panel:

*Volume*

   Speaker volume

*Random Volume*

   Additional volume randomization. The resulting value is calculated
   as for the delay.

*Pitch*

   Sound playback velocity.

*Random Pitch*

   Additional randomization of the sound playback speed. The resulting
   value is calculated as for the delay.

*Fade-In*

   Fade-in time interval.

*Fade-Out*

   Fade-out time interval.

*Disable doppler*

   Ignore source's frequency shift upon its moving.

*Cyclic play*

   Loop the sound playback.

*Delay*

   Delay before sound playback starts.

*Random Delay*

   Additional delay randomization. The resulting value is calculated
   according to the formula Delay_{result} = Delay + Delay_{random} *
   Random_{[0-1]}.

*Loop*

   Loop the sound playback. Contrary to the "Cyclic play" option it
   guarantees a zero delay upon repeat. The option is available only
   for sound sources with "Positional" or "Background Sound" behavior.

Processing and Decoding
=======================


Supported formats (containers):
-------------------------------

* ogg, Vorbis codec (Chrome, Firefox)

* mp3 (Chrome, Safari)

* mp4, AAC codec (Chrome, Safari)

It is recommended to use **Ogg** as it is an open standard, is
widespread in browsers and provides good sound quality. The optimal
format in respect to the quality and compatibility is 48kHz/16bit.
Single-channel sound (mono) is used to store shot samples while two-
channel sound (stereo) is used for music playback.

Converting resources between different formats is described in the
corresponding section.
