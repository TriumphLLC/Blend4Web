Running The Scenes Viewer.


Navigation
==========

To control the camera hold down a mouse button and move the mouse.
Also control can be performed using the "W", "A", "S", "D", "R", "F"
keys: forward, left, back, right, up, down. Arrows and "numpad" keys
can be used as well. In the "Target" camera mode it's possible to
focus on the selected object using the "Z" or ".(dot)" keys.


The Side Panel
==============

The side panel consists of three areas: the information board, basic
control buttons and the list of drop-down panels with additional
control elements differentiated by functionality.

Control elements list in top-to-bottom order
--------------------------------------------

**Build**
   The engine build date and time. In the developer version this shows
   the page load time.

**Scene**
   Loaded scene name from the "assets.json" file. Path to the file
   pops-up on mouse hover.

**Loaded**
   Loading progress and time.

**Reset**
   This button deletes the saved name of the last viewed scene and
   reloads the page back to display the default scene.

**LOW Q - HIGH Q - ULTRA Q**
   Drop-down menu for choosing the performance profile of the engine.

   See also: Quality Profiles

**Pause**
   Pause rendering.

**Resume**
   Resume rendering.

**Auto View**
   Activate the automatic scene switching mode; the delay between
   views is 1 second.

**Scenes**
   A double-level list of the categories and scenes from the
   "assets.json" file.

**Animation**
   Animation controls. When viewing animated models it's possible: to
   select an object and switch its animation with a drop-down menu,
   switch cyclic animation mode, stop and resume animation, set the
   required frame (the animation should be stopped).

**Materials**
   Material properties setup. A material can be selected using the
   drop-down menu. At the moment only a limited range of properties is
   supported.

**Lighting**
   Direct lighting parameters setup. A light source can be selected
   using the drop-down menu. Changing color and intensity is
   supported. Daytime and sun lighting parameters can also be tweaked
   on this panel.

**Ambient**
   Ambient lighting parameters setup. Changing the colors and
   intensity of a hemispheric ambient model is supported.

**Shadows**
   Shadow parameters setup, including shadow cascades and shadow edges
   softening parameters.

**Sky**
   Dynamic sky parameters setup such as color, sun light scattering
   parameters etc.

**Sea**
   Water rendering parameters setup, including color transitions by
   depth and by shore distance, foam and subsurface scattering
   parameters, waves dynamics etc.

**Fog**
   Fog parameters setup, including density and color.

**Wind**
   Wind parameters setup, including direction and strength.

**Screen Space Amb Occlus**
   Ambient occlusion parameters setup.

**God Rays**
   Crepuscular rays effect parameters setup.

**Bloom**
   Bright light effect parameters setup.

**Depth of Field**
   Depth of field effect parameters setup.

**Color correction**
   Color correction parameters setup, including brightness, contrast,
   exposure and saturation.

**Anti-aliasing**
   Selecting the anti-aliasing method.

**Audio**
   There is a mixing mode switch on the panel. After it is enabled the
   mixer interface becomes visible (only for scenes with sound
   sources).

**Stereo View**
   There is a stereoscopy mode switch on the panel.

**Debug**
   This panel contains a range of debugging tools, including the
   wireframe mode and the postprocessing stages viewer switches.


Indicators
==========

**Frames per second counter**
   This is located in the top right corner. It displays the averaged
   and rounded value for the last 1.5 seconds.

**Viewport dimensions**
   This is located in the top left corner. It displays the viewport
   dimensions in pixels.

**Selected object and controlled object**
   This is located in the left bottom corner. It displays the names of
   selected and controlled objects. Object selection can be performed
   with the mouse. To control the object directly (normally for
   physics debugging) press the "Q" key and click on the object. The
   object movement is performed with the "W", "A", "S", "D" keys. To
   exit the control mode press the "Q" key and click on an empty
   space. The indicator also displays the distance to the selected
   object in Blender units (meters equivalent).

**Scene complexity indicator**
   Is located in the top right corner of the rendering area. It
   displays the number of vertices, triangles and WebGL calls on the
   main rendering scene (i.e. shadow rendering calls are not included,
   for example).

**Video memory indicator**
   Is located in the bottom right corner of the rendering area. It
   displays the amount of video memory used by geometry, textures,
   render targets, and also the total memory usage.

**Scene load errors indicator**
   Is located under the FPS counter. Shows errors and warnings which
   occurred during scene load. Red light means errors, yellow -
   warnings and green means that the scene was loaded successfully.
