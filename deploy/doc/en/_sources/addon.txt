.. _local_development_server:

Local Development Server
------------------------

Settings for the local development server can be found in :file:`File > User Preferences...` (hot keys :file:`Ctrl-Alt-U`). Here you can change the port number to be used to run the development server (6687 by default), and also enable its launching upon Blender startup. To do this, enable ``Run on Startup`` option in the add-on settings.

After changing local development server settings in it required to restart Blender.

It is possible for the local server to process external requests. To do that enable the option ``Enable External Requests``.

If you chose not to start the server automatically, you can always do it manually: go to the ``Render`` tab and press the ``Start Server`` button on the ``Development Server`` panel:

   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

.. note::

    If the path to the Blend4Web SDK is not specified, the local development server cannot be launched. In this case the corresponding message will be displayed instead of the ``Start Server`` button.

    If the server is failed to run, an error message will be shown describing the reason:

    .. image:: src_images/setup/error.png
       :align: center

    This error can arise if the server port is already used by some other application.

Press the ``SDK Index`` button to open the index web page of the Blend4Web SDK in the browser. This page is available at http://localhost:6687.

.. image:: src_images/setup/server_open.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

As a result, the default browser for your operating system will be launched.

The ``Project Manager`` button can be used to open :ref:`project manager <project_management>`.

The ``Fast Preview`` button loads the scene that is currently open in Blender, into the :ref:`viewer <viewer>`.

The server can be stopped by pressing the ``Stop Server`` button. It also stops when Blender is closed.


.. index:: viewer; launch

.. _getting_started_launching_viewer:

Running Viewer and Demos
------------------------

The index page contains links for launching the scene viewer and the demo applications. A :ref:`WebGL-capable browser <browser_webgl_support>` is required to run these apps.

.. image:: src_images/setup/setup_sdk_index.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

.. note::

   If the SDK apps are not displayed correctly, or error messages are shown, follow the instructions in the :ref:`renderer_not_working` section.

.. _export_formats:

Export Formats
==============

After the scene is finished, you need to convert it into a format supported by the Blend4Web engine.

For now, two formats are supported: JSON and HTML.

JSON
----

Exporting the scene to this format creates a ``.json`` (JavaScript Object Notation) file that contains all exported data structures and links to external resources (images, sounds and such), and also a ``.bin`` file that contains model data arrays in binary format.

If media resources are `packed into the .blend file <https://www.blender.org/manual/data_system/introduction.html#pack-and-unpack-data>`_, they will be unpacked during the export and placed to the hidden ``../tmp/`` folder in the project's directory (inside the SDK directory). It should be noted that the names of such files will be automatically changed, which can complicate working with them.

It is recommended to store all the resources in a dedicated folder inside the SDK directory, it can be called ``deploy/assets/project_name`` for example.

.. note::
    In accordance with the security measures, the development server can only access the SDK folder. If media data is placed in another folder, the server won't be able to deploy it during the export (even if it is working correctly in Blender itself).

Paths to the external resources should be relative. If this is not the case,  execute the ``File > External Data > Make All Paths Relative`` command, or  else problems with opening the file on other computers may occur.

This is the main format for complex projects that include multiple scenes and require JavaScript programming. Project development is further described in the  :ref:`corresponding section <developers>`.

HTML
----

Exporting the scene to this format pack all scene resources into one file with the HTML extension. This HTML file contains not only the scene itself, but also textures, sounds, Blend4Web engine and standard :ref:`web player <web_player>`. A file like this can be executed on any computer and any mobile device that have a web browser with WebGL support.

You can't use HTML files for further development, but you also don't need any additional actions to run them. This format is useful for developing relatively simple applications of moderate size (?).

.. _export_opts:

Export Options
==============

*Autosave blend File*
    Autosaving the file from which export occurs. **Enabled by default**. Autosaving is performed right after the export to guarantee conformity between the current blend file and the exported file contents. In addition, the relative path to the exported file is saved for convenience.

.. image:: src_images/addon/addon_save_mode.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

*Strict Mode*
    This mode prevents export if there are any errors or messages for users' attention. This mode is enabled with the ``Strict Mode`` setting in the export menu:

.. image:: src_images/addon/addon_strict_mode.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

    If there are any non-critical errors or messages for users' attention, a dialog window will be show like this:

.. image:: src_images/addon/addon_messages.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

*Export Converted Media*
    This option is available for HTML export. When this option is enabled, the converted media files of different formats are written in the HTML file. Using different media files is essential to create cross-browser and cross-platform applications while using HTML export. These files can be created by the :ref:`converter <converter>`.

.. image:: src_images/addon/addon_media_data.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

|

.. _run_in_viewer:

*Run in Viewer*
    Automatically launch the Scene Viewer and add the exported scene to it.

    When using the :ref:`local development server <local_development_server>`, there is a possibility to open the exported ``.json`` scene in the Scene Viewer. To do this, select any path inside the Blend4Web SDK file structure upon export.
    
    A directory inside the SDK should be used for export. If not, this option will not be displayed in the menu. Also, it will not be displayed if the local development server is down.

Initialization Errors
=====================

Initialization errors can arise upon installation of the add-on or when a scene is opened in Blender. In this case a dialog window with the error description is showed.

Compatibility Errors
====================

Compatibility errors may arise when trying to view a scene in a browser, in the following cases: if version of the add-on used to export the scene differs from version of the Blend4Web engine which tries to load the scene, or if .bin file does not correspond to the .json file.







Engine version is too old as compared to version of the add-on with which the scene was exported. The scene will not be loaded. We recommend you to use the latest versions of the engine and the add-on.

Non-Critical Export Errors

In contrast to the above-listed critical export errors, these errors do not prohibit the export, but can make scenes displayed incorrectly. These messages can be viewed in the browser console (opens with ``F12``) when a scene is loaded. The message looks like this:
