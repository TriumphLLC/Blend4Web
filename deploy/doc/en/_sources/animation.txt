Animation
*********

In general animation is changing the object's parameters in time. The
engine supports the following types of animation:

* Object animation means the transformation of an object as a whole.

* Skeletal animation, i.e. object deformation using bones. Animation
  of a standalone armature object is also supported (for parenting to
  bones).

* Vertex animation. An object's deformations can be recorded as
  frames and then reproduced in the engine.

* Audio sources parametrization. Speaker's "Volume" and "Pitch" can
  be animated.

* Animation of the "Value" node output in node materials.

* Wind bending - a procedural animation. Described separately.

* Particle emission. Described in the corresponding section.


Animation Control
=================

There are two ways to control animation in the engine:

1. Automatically, activating the "Animation" panel and choosing the
   "Behaviour" parameter in the object's properties. In this case an
   appropriate animation method will be chosen by the engine and the
   object's animation playback will start just after a scene is
   loaded. In case of skeletal animation the action which is assigned
   to the object in the "Action Editor" window is played by default.

2. In an application via API using the "animation" module methods.

It's useful to use the "Animation" interface for tweaking animation.
This is covered in the corresponding section.


Object Animation
================

The parameters that can be animated are the center coordinates
("Location"), "Rotation" and "Scale".

Animation keyframes can be added for an object motion in Blender and
then reproduced in the engine.

The following keyframe types are supported:

* *Location*

* *Rotation* -- the "Quaternion(WXYZ)" or "XYZ Euler" mode is
  required.

* *Scale* -- for correct results the scale factor should be the same
  along all 3 axes.

* *LocRot* -- a combination of *Location* and *Rotation*.

* *LocScale* -- a combination of *Location* and *Scale*.

* *LocRotScale* -- a combination of *Location*, *Rotation* and
  *Scale*.

* *RotScale* -- a combination of *Rotation* and *Scale*.

If a mesh object is animated it is required to activate the "Force
Dynamic Object" option on the "Rendering Propetries" panel under the
object properties tab.


Skinning and Skeletal Animation
===============================

For skeletal animation both a mesh object and an armature object are
needed. The four steps should be carried out:

1. Create the object's "skeleton" in the armature object.

2. Assign vertex groups in the mesh object and link them to the
   bones. This can be performed by weight painting for example.

3. Animate the bones in the pose mode of the armature object. The
   same keyframe types can be used as for the object animation.

4. When inverse kinematics (IK) or other nontrivial structures are
   used, an additional step is required to bake the animations
   ("Action" datablocks in Blender). Baking can be performed using the
   "Bake Skeletal Animation" interface located on the "Blend4Web"
   panel.

Baking is performed with the armature object selected. Elements of the
"Bake Skeletal Animation" interface:

* A window with the list of actions being baked -- bake only the
  actions which are listed, else - bake all the actions possible.

* *Name* -- the current action name from the list of actions being
  baked.

* *Optimize keyframes* -- optimize the animation keyframes after
  baking. In case of incorrect results it's recommended to turn this
  option off.

* *Bake* -- perform baking. If the process is completed
  successfully, actions with names of *NAME_B4W_BAKED* type appear in
  the scene. These actions can be assigned to the armature object and
  played back in the engine. It's worth noting that appropriate
  functioning of such actions in Blender is not garanteed.

Note: The engine supports up to 4 vertex groups per vertex. If the
  number of vertex groups exceeds 4 the vertex groups with the most
  influence are selected. When the scene is loaded the vertex weights
  are normalized i.e. their sum is reduced to 1.To remove vertex
  groups which are not used by armature, use button "Remove Clean
  Unused Vertex Groups".[image]


Vertex Animation
================

Allows to record any geometry changes of a mesh object. Note that
every vertex animation frame counts as a mesh. It's not recommended to
make a long animation for a high-poly mesh, as it can increase the
size of the source and exported files significantly and can also slow
down the work of the engine.

A special tool is used for baking vertex animation - "Bake Vertex
Animation" - located on the "Blend4Web" tools panel.

Audio Source Parametrization
============================

In addition the following animation key types are supported for the
speaker objects:

* *Volume*

* *Pitch*

Audio sources parametering in essence follows object animation.


Animation of Value and RGB Nodes
================================

Playback of keyframes inserted on "Value" and "RGB" nodes is supported
in node materials.

Note: Animation of numerical and color values on other nodes is not
  supported.

Can be also used to create tracks in the non-linear animation editor.
Multiple animated "Value" or "RGB" nodes are supported per single
material. Values of these nodes can be also modified via API, by using
the "set_nodemat_value" and "set_nodemat_rgb" methods of the "objects"
module.
