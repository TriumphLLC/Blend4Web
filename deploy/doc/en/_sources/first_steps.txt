Quick Install
*************

Quick install of the Blend4Web addon suits Blender artists who have no
need in full-scale 3D applications development. In this case the main
benefit is the opportunity to export a scene into a single HTML file
for viewing in WebGL-capable browsers.

For more serious tasks an SDK setup is required.


Installing Blender
==================

Authoring 3D scenes is carried out directly in Blender which is open
source software and is distributed free of charge.

A current stable version of Blender should be used. It can be
downloaded from the official site.

Installing the Addon
====================

Run Blender, load the default scene "File > New". Open the user
preferences "File > User Preferences...". Under the "Addons" tab click
"Install from File..." and then select the zip archive with the addon
files. After that turn on the "Import-Export: Blend4Web"  checkbox.

Then click "Save User Settings" and close the user preferences window.


Exporting and Viewing Scenes
============================

The created scenes can be exported in HTML format. To do this use the
"File > Export > Blend4Web (.html)" menu option and choose the export
filepath. The resulting HTML file can be opened with any browser with
WebGL support.

Upgrading the Addon
===================

To upgrade the addon **first disable the old version and then remove
it**.

To disable the addon: run Blender, load the default scene "File >
New". Open the user preferences "File > User Preferences...". Go to
the "Addons" tab and choose the "Import-Export" category. Disable the
"Import-Export: Blend4Web" checkbox. Then click "Save User Settings"
and **restart Blender**.

Then to remove the addon open the user preferences window again,
expand the Blend4Web info panel and click the "Remove" button.
