Materials
*********

Materials describe the object surface's response to light and also
contain information about its transparency, reflectivity, physical
parameters and so on.

Meshes can have one or more materials. In case of multiple materials
they can be assigned to different polygons in the "Edit Mode". To do
this select the needed polygons, select the needed material from the
list and click the "Assign" button.

The following material types are supported: "Surface", "Halo".


Lighting Parameters
===================

[image]

*Diffuse > Color*
   Diffuse light color. The default value is (0.8, 0.8, 0.8). It may
   interact with the diffuse map color.

*Diffuse > Intensity*
   Diffuse light intensity. The default value is 0.8.

*Diffuse > Shader*
   Diffuse shading algorithm. The default value is "Lambert".

*Specular > Color*
   Specular light color. The default value is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0). It may
   interact with the specular map color.

*Specular > Intensity*
   Specular light intensity. The default value is 0.5.

*Specular > Hardness*
   Exponent in the specular shading calculation formula. The default
   value is 50. Note that the formula used in the engine differs
   slightly from the Blender's one.

*Specular > Shader*
   Specular shading algorithm. The default value is "CookTorr".

*Shading > Emit*
   Emission intensity. The default value is 0.0.

*Shading > Ambient*
   Ambient influence factor on material. The default value is 1.0.

*Shading > Shadeless*
   When enabled, a material doesn't react to light. Disabled by
   default.

*Shading > Double-sided Lighting*
   Enables the double-sided lighting mode. This option is useful for
   non-transparent objects with a single-layered mesh.


Transparency
============

[image]


Types
-----

Transparency implementation type can be selected in the "Transparency"
menu on the "Properties > Material" panel.

The engine supports the following transparency implementation types
(sorted in the ascending order by performance):

*Alpha Sort*
   Transparent with a gradient. The engine sorts the triangles by
   camera distance in order to render overlapping transparent surfaces
   correctly. This operation is computationally expensive. It is
   recommended to use this feature for closed transparent geometry
   (bottle, car glass etc).

*Alpha Blend*
   Transparent with a gradient. The sorting of triangles is not
   performed. It is recommended to use this feature for unclosed
   transparent geometry (water surface, decals).

*Add*
   Transparent with a gradient. The sorting of triangles is not
   performed. The engine disables writing to the depth buffer which
   causes transparent surfaces to be rendered in arbitrary order. It
   is recommended to use this feature for effects (particle systems,
   glowing beams).

*Alpha Clip*
   Transparent without a gradient. The engine discards pixels if their
   alpha is less than 0.5. The sorting of triangles is not performed.
   It is recommended to use this feature with a mask texture to
   visualize smaller details (tree leaves, grass).

*Opaque*
   Non-transparent. Alpha is ignored. This is the default value.

Additional settings
-------------------

*Transparency > Show Transparency*
   Enabling the transparency checkbox is required for viewing
   transparent objects in Blender. The engine ignores this option -
   the "Alpha Blend" option is used instead.

*Transparency > Alpha*
   Material transparency level. The engine ignores this parameter (in
   contrast to Blender) if there is a diffuse texture - the alpha
   channel values of a texture are used instead.

*Transparency > Z Offset*, depth offset
   This option explicitly specifies relative positioning order of
   objects with **different** materials with the purpose of depth
   sorting. The option can take both negative and positive values. The
   more distant the object is the lesser parameter value should be to
   provide correct rendering. The default value is 0.0.


Reflection
==========

[image]


Static reflection
-----------------

A surface reflects the same image no matter how the environment
changes. For activation simply use the mirror map.

See also: Fresnel effect for reflection


Dynamic reflection
------------------

A surface reflects the selected objects in their current position. The
engine supports planar and spherical reflections


Activation
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check "Reflections" setting on the "Render > Reflections and
   Refractions" panel.

2. For *reflective* objects enable the "Reflective" option on the
   "Object > Reflections" panel.

   * For planar reflections, set the "Object > Reflections > Type"
     property to "Plane". After that, add an empty object to be used
     as a reflection plane by executing for example "Add > Empty >
     Single Arrow". Rename it for convenience and specify its name in
     the "Reflection plane" field of the reflective object.

   * For cube-mapped reflections, set the "Object > Reflections >
     Type" property to "Cube".

3. For the needed materials of the *reflective* objects, set the
   "Material > Mirror > Reflectivity" value.

   * "Mirror > Reflectivity > Show Reflectivity" is required for
     displaying reflections on objects in Blender. The engine ignores
     this option.

4. For the *reflexible* objects, enable the "Reflexible" checkbox
   on the "Object > Reflections" panel.

Note: It is also recommended to enable the "World > Environment
  Lighting" checkbox.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Normal maps and shadows are ignored in the reflected image for
optimization purposes.

See also: Fresnel effect for reflection


Fresnel effect for reflection
-----------------------------

The Fresnel effect manifests itself as the dependency of the intencity
of passing and reflected light on the incidence angle. If the angle of
incidence is close to zero (i.e. light falls almost at right angle to
the surface) the passing light portion is large and the reflected
light portion is small. On the contrary if the angle of incidence is
close to 90 degrees (i.e. light falls almost parallel to the surface)
almost all light is reflected.

The engine uses the approximate Schlick's formula:

   R = R_0 + (1 − R_0)(1 - cos θ)^N, where

   R - reflection coefficient,

   R_0 - reflection coefficient in case of viewing at a right angle to
   the surface (i.e. when θ = 0),

   θ - angle of incidence (which is equal to the angle of reflection
   under which light enters the camera), it is calculated by the
   engine in real-time,

   N - exponent.


Settings
~~~~~~~~

Fresnel effect can be set up both for static and dynamic reflection.

*Material > Mirror > Fresnel*
   Fresnel power for reflection. This is the N exponent in the
   Schlick's formula. In Blender it is limited to values from 0 to 5.
   If this parameter is equal to zero the Fresnel effect is not
   observed and the *full* reflection at all angles occurs. If this
   parameter is greater than zero, the material is less reflective
   when viewing surfaces at angles which are close to the right angle.
   The bigger this parameter is the bigger is the angle deviation from
   the right angle for which the Fresnel effect is observed.

*Material > Mirror > Blend*
   Fresnel factor for reflection. It is reduced to R_0 in the
   Schlick's formula by the following expression: R_0 = 1 - "Blend" /
   5. In Blender it is limited to values from 0 to 5. This parameter
   defines the Fresnel effect intensity: the bigger the "Blend" factor
   is, the more is the Fresnel effect influence. If it is equal to
   zero the Fresnel effect is not observed.

*Material > Rendering Options > Vertex Color Paint*
   Mesh vertex color is used instead of the material diffuse color
   when the checkbox is enabled.
