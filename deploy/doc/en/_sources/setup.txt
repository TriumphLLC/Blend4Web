Installing the SDK
******************

Setting up the development environment suits 3D application
developers. To familiarize yourself with the Blend4Web addon quick
install can be a better option.

Before installation, please download and install the compatible
Blender version, according to this table.


Unpacking the Archive
=====================

Stable versions of the distribution are available as an archive
("blend4web_sdk_free_YY_MM.zip" -- free SDK,
"blend4web_sdk_pro_YY_MM.zip" -- commercial SDK). Simply unpack this
archive somewhere.


Setting up the Add-on
=====================

Note: We strongly recommend to remove the addon first if it was
  originally installed using quick install.

Run Blender, load the default scene "File > New" (hot keys "Ctrl-N").
Open the user preferences window "File > User Preferences..." (hot
keys "Ctrl-Alt-U"). Under the "File" tab in the "Scripts" field,
choose the path to the "blender_scripts" directory.

Click "Save User Settings" and **restart** Blender.

Again load the default scene, open the user preferences window, go to
the "Addons" tab and choose the "Import-Export" category. Enable the
"Import-Export: Blend4Web" checkbox.

Click "Save User Settings". Restarting Blender isn't required.

*To check:*

In the "File > Export" menu, the "Blend4Web (.json)" and "Blend4Web
(.html)" options should appear.

==============

To reveal the engine settings, select Blend4Web from the upper panel
menu:

Local Development Server
========================

Settings for the local development server can be found in "File > User
Preferences..." (hot keys "Ctrl-Alt-U"). Here you can change the port
number to be used to run the development server (6687 by default), and
also enable its launching upon Blender startup. To do this, enable
"Run on Startup" option in the add-on settings.

After changing local development server settings in it required to
restart Blender.

It is possible for the local server to process external requests. To
do that enable the option "Enable External Requests".

If you chose not to start the server automatically, you can always do
it manually: go to the "Render" tab and press the "Start Server"
button on the "Development Server" panel:

Note: If the path to the Blend4Web SDK is not specified, the local
  development server cannot be launched. In this case the
  corresponding message will be displayed instead of the "Start
  Server" button.If the server is failed to run, an error message will
  be shown describing the reason:[image]This error can arise if the
  server port is already used by some other application.

Press the "SDK Index" button to open the index web page of the
Blend4Web SDK in the browser. This page is available at
http://localhost:6687.

As a result, the default browser for your operating system will be
launched.

The "Project Manager" button can be used to open project manager.

The "Fast Preview" button loads the scene that is currently open in
Blender, into the viewer.

The server can be stopped by pressing the "Stop Server" button. It
also stops when Blender is closed.


Running Viewer and Demos
========================

The index page contains links for launching the scene viewer and the
demo applications. A WebGL-capable browser is required to run these
apps.

Note: If the SDK apps are not displayed correctly, or error messages
  are shown, follow the instructions in the Problems Upon Startup
  section.
