*************


v15.07
======


New Features
------------

* Support for "Alpha Clip" transparency for node materials.

     It is now possible to specify a transparency mask for "Alpha
     Clip" materials using node logic.

* Support for soft particles.

     The new property "Soft Particles" has been added to the "Render"
     panel of the "Emitter" particle system. When activated, this
     property renders smooth edges near opaque objects located on the
     scene. This effect is available only for materials with "Alpha
     Sort", "Alpha Blend" or "Add" type of transparency.

* New preprocessor for shader instructions.

     This new preprocessor has more straightforward architecture and
     works faster, which, in turn, greatly reduces overall scene
     loading time, especially in  cases with many different shaders.

* Improved *Viewer* app performance.

     Performance problems caused by event handling in jQuery Mobile
     library have been fixed.

* Zero level property for *HOVER* cameras.

     This property represents a Z coordinate of the reference plane in
     which the camera's pivot point is located.

* New sensor manifold type: "CT_CHANGE".

     Along with "CT_CONTINOUS", "CT_TRIGGER", "CT_SHOT" and "CT_LEVEL"
     manifold types the new "CT_CHANGE" type can now be used. This
     type allows to execute a manifold's callback right after any of
     the sensors' values in the manifold has been changed.

* New APIs in *camera_anim* module.

     New API methods such as move_camera_to_point(), rotate_camera(),
     is_moving() and is_rotating() have been added to module
     camera_anim.

* A new option to assign materials to objects.

     Until now it has not been possible to assign meterials on objects
     using "Object" property. Now, this feature is supported.

* Support for external requests to the local development server.

     This feature is enabled by the *Enable external requests*
     property in addon prefrences.

* New method clear_animation() in the time module.

* New camera APIs.

     APIs of camera module has been extended by get_vertical_limits()
     and has_vertical_limits() methods which are used to get or check
     the camera's vertical rotation and translation limits.

* Documentation improvements.

     New user manual design optimized for devices of all kind.

     The differences between coordinate systems used in Blender and
     Blend4Web are now specified in documentation.

* Support for addon i18n.

     This feature allows translation of addon interface to different
     languages. The translation into Russian is almost complete.


Changes
-------

* Various usability improvements in the addon interface.

* New "force_container_ratio" option in the init() method.

* Simplified usage of water caustics.

     Water caustics effect is now activated by the "Caustics" option
     located on the material's "Water" panel.

* New way of evaluating mouse movement sensors.

     Now all elements inside the Canvas Container element (e.g
     Anchors) do not lock mouse events, thus allowing us to prevent
     glitches during camera movement.

* Option to change quality of reflections.

     Now it is possible to choose one of three predefined reflection
     quality modes: "LOW", "MEDIUM" or "HIGH".

* New properties "--project" and "--app" in the *project.py*
  utility.

* New animation APIs.

     New methods to simplify frame setting:
     set_first_frame()/set_last_frame().

* New behavior of plane reflections.

     It is now possible to omit specifying the reflection normal by
     leaving the "Reflection Plane" option empty. In this case, local
     Z axis will be used instead.

* New SSAO behavior.

     Now there is no need to have shadow casters in the scene to use
     the SSAO effect.

* New texture anisotropic filtering settings.

     There is a new "Default" value for anisotropic filtering option
     assigned to textures. By selecting this value you can use the
     anisotropic filtering specified on the scene. If you need to
     disable anisotropic filtering on all textures, again, use the
     setting from the scene.

* New specular alpha shading behavior to match Blender's.

* The physics mask/group, assigned for collision materials, has been
  extended from 8 to 16 bits.

* New asynchronous shader loader for developer version of Blend4Web.

* Elimination of *shaders* module.

     The methods of this module is now available from the debug
     module.

* New script for batch processing exported json/html files.

     The scripts *reexporter.py* and *resaver.py* have been combined
     into *process_blend.py*, which has options for processing
     exported json/html files.

* Minor refactoring and improvements in API documentation.


Fixes
-----

* Fixed a bug with incorrect Canvas element size appeared on the
  engine's startup.

* Fixed a lighting bug on objects with the negative "Scale" option.

     This condition is properly handled and reported to the user (in
     the browser console).

* Fixed a bug with object's vertex animation.

* Fixed a bug with animation played in reverse.

* Fixed an error with incorrect state of *Collision* and *Ray*
  sensors which appeared after deleting physics objects.

* *Environment* textures with dimensions exceeding the supported
  ones are now processed correctly.

     Now, such textures are not being turned off but rendered in
     reduced scale instead. Dimensions are reduced synthetically for
     NVIDIA GeForce 8000 GPUs on Windows Chrome.

* Fixed an issue with incorrectly reported error which appeared
  while loading scenes with missing camera/world.

* Fixed a Blender startup error with the world missing from the
  scene.

* Fixed a bug in the "Webplayer" app when the sound button was
  missing in some scenes.

* Fixed a bug in the scenes when *motion blur* is the only effect to
  appear.

* Fixed the get_material_extended_params() method in the material
  module.

* Fixed Firefox Mobile crashes when using shadows. Improved overall
  stability for this browser.

* Improved reexporter stability.


Known Issues
------------

* Problems with updating of the add-on.

     The addons which have version 15.05 or earlier should be deleted
     before a newer version of addon can be installed. This is
     especially important on Windows. After deleting the old version,
     Blender must be restarted.

* NVIDIA 331 driver in Linux can cause WebGL errors.

* There is a bug with video textures on Chrome 43 for Android.

     Please update your Chrome browser to Beta or wait until the next
     Chrome update.

* Fixed issues with the "Background Music" speakers in the scenes
  exported to html.

     Currently, there is a bug in Google Chrome (Issue 511251),
     related to an error with audio file origin. Currently, this issue
     is partially resolved by our workaround with forced *crossOrigin*
     attribute on audio sources.

* Changed texture filtering on some platforms.

     An incorrect texture filtering was disabled on iPad and Internet
     Explorer for materials with *Alpha Clip* type of transparency.


v15.06
======


New Features
------------

* New add-on user interface.

     Add-on interface has been redesigned. It is now activated by the
     new rendering profile, *Blend4Web*, which only contains panels
     and options explicitly supported by the engine. To simplify
     navigation, the old multi-line Blend4Web panels have been re-
     grouped into the smaller ones, based on functionality.

     Also, there is a new feature to automatically assign graphic
     effects required for a scene. In particular, shadows, refraction,
     *Glow* and *Outline* effects acquired the new *AUTO* property
     which automatically activates them if some objects or materials
     located on the scene require such effects.

* New normal editor.

     The normal editor has been substantially upgraded. Now it is
     fully compatible with the native Blender datablock used to store
     normals. This new editor has more efficient UI and also allows to
     edit split normals.

* Support for new material nodes.

     "Orco" and "Local" outputs of *Geometry* node are now supported.
     There are also some preliminary steps to support *RGB Curves*,
     *Vector Curves*, *ColorRamp* and Cycles nodes.

* New shading models.

     *Minnaert*/*Toon* diffuse shaders and *Blinn* specular shader
     have been implemented. Thus, starting from this release the
     engine supports all shading models of Blender.

* Support for Blender 2.75

* Multiple physics improvements.

     Code for collision detection has been rewritten. Now it is
     possible to determine colliding objects, and also the coordinates
     and the normal at the collision point.

     Improved ray casting API. In particular, one can specify an
     option to perform an automatic cleanup of the ray test object and
     also another option to cast a ray through multiple objects. As in
     the case of collision detection, this new API allows to determine
     the target object and the position/normal of the hit point. There
     is also a new possibility to cast rays from point to point in
     global space, without requirement to specify a source object.

     Extended possibilites of *Collision* and *Ray* sensors.

     Support for deleting physics objects and automatic recalculation
     of collision/ray tests after physics objects have been
     added/removed.

* A new tool for reexporting multiple scenes.

     A new *Mass Reexporter* tool has been added to addon. This tool
     allows to automatically reexport all scenes from the specified
     list of directories.

* Possibility to check for updates.

     You can now enable a "Check for Updates on Startup" option in
     addon settings to perform automatic checks for the new versions
     of Blend4Web.

* API to control *Motion Blur* postprocessing effect.

     New methods to control Motion Blur effect "get_mb_params()" and
     "set_mb_params()" has been added to "scenes.js" module.

* Support for Timeline markers.

     To extract frame numbers from timeline markers a new method
     "marker_frame()" has been implemented in "scenes.js" module.

* New NLA APIs.

     A new set of methods: "set_range()", "reset_range()",
     "set_cyclic()" and "clear_callback()" has been added to "nla.js"
     module. Also, it's now possible to specify callback in "play()"
     method.

* New API to change Canvas resolution.

     To change Canvas resolution it's sufficient to execute method
     "set()" from "config.js" module with the following parameters:
     "canvas_resolution_factor" and "value", where "value" is the new
     resolution of Canvas. This feature is particulary useful for
     creating high-definition screenshots.

* Support for "Vertex Groups -> Length" option in *Hair* particle
  system.

* New API documentation.

     To document types used by Blend4Web applications we developed a
     new formal type system. For example, in our old API docs 3D
     vectors had "Float32Array" type. Now they have formal "Vec3"
     type. This solution allows us to formulate more clear and
     intelligible descriptions for API and, more importantly, helps
     our users to develop more readable and reliable applications.

* New colors API.

     To work with colors in efficient way two new modules: rgb and
     rgba have been created. They include APIs to create new color
     vectors and convert  them between different profiles.

* Automatic determination of path to SDK.

     Addon option "Blend4Web SDK Directory" is filled up
     automatically, if the addon is located in default
     "blender_scripts" directory inside SDK.

* API for correct calculation of Canvas 2D coordinates.

     For proper manipulations with mouse cursor and touchscreen
     devices the engine requires correct 2D Canvas coordinates.

     Details about calculation and use cases of such coordinates are
     described in the separate topic.

     To support this feature the following methods have been added to
     engine's APIs: "client_to_canvas_coords()",
     "set_canvas_offsets()", "update_canvas_offsets()" and
     "force_offsets_updating()". Also, there is a new configuration
     option: "track_container_position".

* API to change smooth factors of the camera's movement.

     To change smooth factors of the camera's movement the following
     APIs have been implemented: "set_plock_smooth_factor()" and
     "get_plock_smooth_factor()" in "mouse.js" module (for Pointer
     Lock mode)  and also "set_camera_smooth_factor()" and
     "get_camera_smooth_factor()" in "app.js" addon (for general use
     cases).

* New favicon picture has been added to Webplayer.


Changes
-------

* New API spec for collision detection and ray casting.

     Methods "append_collision_test()" and "append_ray_test()", as
     well as "create_collision_sensor()" and "create_ray_sensor()" are
     now have new spec, which is incompatible with the previous
     versions of Blend4Web engine. All developers should consider
     upgrading their applications to match this new behavior.

* Rendering to texture changes.

     It's now possible to render scene into texture cyclically, e.g.
     when two scenes render one into another. The main constraint here
     is the requirement to have at least one scene, into which is
     nothing is being rendered.

* The option "Apply Default Animation" is now disabled if an object
  already have an NLA animation attached.

     In cases when the object already have an NLA animation attached,
     the option "Apply Default Animation" is disabled to eliminate
     possible animation conflicts.

* Changed *Hemi* lamp behavior.

     If the object is being illuminated by the *Hemi* lamp, the
     *Lambert* shading model will allways be applied to it's
     materials. This is done to match the Blender's behavior.

* Support for exported-to-HTML video textures in Firefox browser.

     Since Firefox 38 an error with video textures exported to base64
     was fixed, so it's now possible to use them in such browsers.

* Changed assignment of UV layers to match Blender's behavior.

     Missing from node materials UV layers are determined
     automatically as it's done in Blender.

* Improved stability of exported to HTML video textures.

* Optimizations of CSM shadows.

* Depth shader optimizations.

* Billboard objects optimizations.

* Configuration option "resolution_factor" was renamed to
  "render_resolution_factor".

* Improved support for particle emitters which have several
  materials.

     Distribution of the particles to emitters as well as vertex
     colors inheritance is being done taking into account each
     material i.e mesh part.

* Changed "Wind Bending" inheritance on particle systems.

     If *Wind Bending Inheritance* property is set to "Instance" then
     "Wind beinding" property for emitter object is not switched of
     anymore.

* Updated messages about addon/engine version incompatibilities.

     For more info see version errors.

* Remove sensor locks API.

     Unused sensor locks API was removed from "controls.js" module.

* Fixed behavior of node materials with missing *Output* node.


Fixes
-----

* Fixes in "screenshooter.js" addon.

     Fixed an error with impossibilty to take a screenshot.

* Fixed a bug in "set_frame()" method from "nla.js" module.

     Fixed "set_frame()" inaccurancy.

* Improved exported stability.

* Fixed a bug with addon removal/update on Windows.

     Refined binary loader in addon.

* Fixed a bug with shading from *SPOT*/*POINT* lamps.

* Fixed incorrect behavior of coordinate calculations in methods
  "get_coords_x()" and "get_coords_y()" from "mouse.js" addon.

* Fixed calculations of alpha channel in *Outline* effect.

* Fixed *Wind Bending* effect error.

* Fixed an error when particle's *Scale* was not taken into account
  on particle systems.

* Fixed synchronization error on animated *EMITTER* particle
  systems.

* Fixed a bug with shadows on billboard objects.

* Fixed incorrect exporting of *Override Mesh Boundings* settings.

* Fixed a bug with billboard rendering on iPad.


Known Issues
------------

* Problems with updating of the add-on.

     The addons which have version 15.05 or earlier should be deleted
     before a newer version of addon can be installed. This is
     especially important on Windows. After deleting the old version,
     Blender must be restarted.

* NVIDIA 331 driver in Linux can cause WebGL errors.

* There is a bug with video textures on Chrome 43 for Android.

     Please update your Chrome browser to Beta or wait until the next
     Chrome update.


v15.05
======


New Features
------------

* *Glow effect*.

     Supported an effect which occurs when the light scatters in the
     atmosphere and inside of the human eye and looks like a halo
     around glowing objects.

* *The local development server runs automatically.*

     A new option has been added to the addon settings. This option
     turns on automatic start of local development server upon opening
     Blender. With the help of this functional web applications in
     development can be run without any preparations.

* *Cube reflections.*

     Apart from plane reflections, there are now cube reflections
     available. There is a new "Reflection Type" option available when
     "Reflective" flag is set on the object. Setting it to "Cube"
     turns this feature on.

* *More NLA options supported.*

     Added support of Blender's NLA tools: "Scale", "Muted",
     "Reversed" and "Repeat". The support of these tools broadens
     capabilities of interactive scene developers.

     Furthermore, to control NLA through API a new "nla.js" module was
     added. This module contains methods like "play()", "stop()",
     "get_frame()", "set_frame()" that can play/stop NLA and get/set
     the current frame. New methods have been involved in implementing
     control panel interface in the Viewer app.

* *Increased rendering possibilities for sky textures.*

     "Influence" parameters for sky texture rendering are now
     supported. Those parameters are: "Blend", "Horizon", "Zenith Up",
     "Zenith Down",``Blend``, "Negative", "RGB to Intensity", "DVar".

* *In node materials, the engine now correctly processes connections
  between inputs and outputs of different types.*

     It is now possible to connect outputs of one type with inputs of
     another type (Non-critical error). Now Blender's native behaviour
     is supported by the engine.

* *For Hair particles the options on the Rotation panel are now
  supported.*

     Now the engine fully supports the state of particles set in
     Blender. In particular not only location and scale are supported
     now, but rotation as well.

* *Some demos for postprocessing effects demostration were added.*

     Examples were prepared for the following effects: Bloom, Depth of
     Field, God Rays, Motion Blur and SSAO.

* *Added a new module container.js.*

     DOM tree elements can be added with a specific depth relative to
     the  depth of the "canvas" element with the help of
     "container.js"'s "insert_to_container()" method. This method
     replaces CSS property "z-index" because location depth of
     elements is now determined by their position in the container
     element.

* *Improvements in the physical engine.*

     "Margin" property of physical elements and materials is now
     supported. This option allows for improved stability of object
     collision simulation. Bullet engine was updated to version 2.83.

* *API for changing camera controls mode.*

     Added methods of changing movement style of the camera. The
     example can be found in Code Snippets app in the "Camera Move
     Styles" section. Also has been added "set_hover_pivot()" method.
     This method allows to shift the control point of "HOVER" camera.


Changes
-------

* *Reorganized SDK's scene list.*

     All the scenes in the Viewer app has been sorted by groups: *App*
     contains finished apps, *Demos* contains demo-scenes and
     examples, *Tutorial Exports* contains tutorials source files.

* *Added syntax highlight in Code Snippets app.*

     Code Snippets app now has a new design. Also it was optimized for
     low-resolution screens.

* *API controls of video and canvas textures have been changed.*

     A new parameter "data_id" has been added to these textures'
     control methods. This parameter contains an ID of dynamically
     loaded scene.

* *Handling of animated bone excess has been changed.*

     The skeletal animation now just turns off when exceeding the
     maximum number of bones. It resulted in shader compilation error
     and unstable application behaviour before.

* *Some particle system properties has been renamed and now they are
  turned off by default.*

     In particular, Hair particle system's properties "Randomize
     Location And Size" and "Randomize Initial Rotation" are turned
     off by default now.

* *Doppler effect for speakers is now turned off in some browsers.*

     Doppler effect support in Web Audio has been pronounced as
     deprecated and will be removed in Chrome starting from version
     45. Other browsers still support this functionality.

* *Changed objects' behavior when both skeletal and vertex animation
  are applied.*

     If an object has both armature modifier and vertex animation
     applied on it, the armature modifier won't be exported.

* *Rendering of particle system procedural animation (Wind Bending
  effect) has been optimized.*

* *The main .json and .bin scene files loading error handling has
  been improved.*

* *Windows 32 version of Blend4Web addon is now compiled natively.*

     This feature improves addons compatibility on such systems.


Fixes
-----

* *The error that led to the wrong height of the description element
  in module "anchors.js" has been fixed.*

* *Support for Epiphany and other WebKit-based browsers.*

     Achieved by fixing the code which works differently in the
     different JavaScript engines.

* *Gestures on Internet Explorer 11 were disabled for Microsoft
  Windows touch devices.*

     Previously, gestures usage (Windows Touch Gestures) was leading
     to unnecessary HTML-elements scaling and movement on such
     configurations. It is expected that correct gestures behaviour
     will be supported in further browser releases.

* *Vertex animation with animated armature bake error was fixed.*

* *The error with rendering billboard objects on the iPad has been
  fixed.*

* *Node material's NLA animation applied to several objects was
  fixed.*

* *Fixed a bug related to the Motion Blur effect.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly recommend not installing a new version of an addon
     without deleting the old one, especially on Windows. After
     deleting the old version, Blender must be restarted.


v15.04
======


New Features
------------

* *Deformations by using Shape Keys (Morphing).*

     Added support for object's Morph targets (known as Shape Keys in
     Blender). To apply such keys, use the "set_shape_key_value"
     method of the "geometry.js" module. Simple example of how to use
     such functionality is given in the Code Snippets app.

* *Support for Horizon Color and Zenith Color background settings.*

     It's now possible to tweak scene background by using the "Horizon
     Color" and "Zenith Color" properties as well as the "Paper Sky",
     "Blend Sky" and "Real Sky" options directly from Blender.

* *Support for the Gamma node.*

     We have implemented the Gamma node back in Blender v2.74. Now
     this node is finally supported by Blend4Web.

* *Various improvements in the Anchors tool.*

     It's now possible to limit the pixel size of an annotation. Added
     support for dynamic loading/unloading of Anchors. Implemented the
     possibility to hide and show Anchors by using the
     *show()*/*hide()* API functions and/or by the NLA Script tool.

* *Shader optimizations.*

     Shader compiler improvements. Added the following features: local
     variables optimizations, brackets removal. Improved the
     performance of node materials.

* *Physics engine optimizations.*

     To save the load time, the physics modules are now loaded only
     when explicitly required. Overall size of the modules has been
     decreased by 20%.

* *Extended tools for physics debugging.*

     The new *physics_stat()* method has been added to the debug
     module. This method returns physics statistics such as the number
     of physics objects (separated by type), amount of geometry and
     other info. It is now also possible to display the number of
     physics iterations per second aka Physics FPS (activated in the
     *config* module).

* *The new API method to attach objects to the camera independently
  from the camera's aspect ratio or the field of view.*

     Implemented in the *append_stiff_viewport()* method of the
     constraints module.

* *The new module to perform transformations: "tsr.js".*

     This new module makes it possible to apply a variety of
     tranformations to objects by using versatile TSR vectors. Each
     TSR vector combines translation, scale and rotation (hence the
     name). These vectors may be used instead of matrices as a more
     convenient and effective way to apply transformations.

* *The possibility to exclude any directories from being converted
  by the resource converter.*

     To exclude some directory from being converted by the resource
     converter, it is enough to place a file named ".b4w_no_conv" to
     this directory.


Changes
-------

* *The API documentation has changed its appearance. Links for quick
  access to methods and properties were added.*

* *Skeletal animation now takes into account the relative
  translation of an armature and a skinned object.*

     Native Blender's behavior is now supported. There is now no need
     to position an armature and an animated object in the same place
     and with the same rotation and scale.

* *Independent translation, rotation and scale animations are now
  supported.*

     The animation system no more forces keyframes to be present in
     every channel, which makes it possible to save original values in
     unused channels or change them with API.

* *World background support.*

     Background and sky can be enabled with the "Sky Settings > Render
     Sky" option under the "World" tab. It is turned off by default.

* *The Uranium physics engine now consists of two modules.*

     There are now two physics modules instead of one: *uranium.js* -
     the engine's code and *uranium.js.mem* - the file for memory
     initialization. Both modules must be placed in the same
     directory.

* *The glow effect together with its related components was renamed
  to Outline.*

     The new name better describes the principle of this effect:
     highlighting objects' edges.

* *Limiting the camera translation using the "append_semi_stiff_cam"
  method of the "constraints.js" module is now possible only for the
  "EYE" type.*

* *Local development server for Blender was replaced by a new one.*

     Now, instead of the standard Python SimpleHTTPServer, the Tornado
     web server is used as the local development server. The new
     server has greater performance and it also offers more options to
     disable browser cache.

* *Keyboard controls for sliders in the Viewer application were
  added.*

     You can now control sliders with "<" and ">"  keys.

* *Changes in the "update_object_animation" method of the
  "animation.js" module.*

     The optional "force_update" parameter was added. It forces
     animated objects to be updated even when their animation is not
     being played back.

* *API changes in the mouse.js module.*

     The *enable_mouse_hover_outline* and
     *disable_mouse_hover_outline* methods were added.

     The following methods were declared deprecated and will be
     removed in the next releases: *enable_mouse_hover_glow* and
     *disable_mouse_hover_glow*.

* API changes in the *scenes.js module.*

     The *outlining_is_enabled*, *set_outline_intensity*,
     *get_outline_intensity*, *apply_outline_anim*,
     *apply_outline_anim_def*, *clear_outline_anim*,
     *set_outline_color* and *get_outline_color* methods were added.

     The following methods were declared deprecated and will be
     removed in the next releases: *set_glow_intensity*,
     *get_glow_intensity*, *apply_glow_anim*, *apply_glow_anim_def*,
     *clear_glow_anim*, *set_glow_color* and *get_glow_color*.

* *Some settings were changed in the Object > Blend4Web panel.*

     The *Enable Outline* option was added to enable using the outline
     effect on the given object. Also, the *Outline on Select* option
     was added to activate glow animation when the object is selected
     (previously this behavior was defined by the *Selectable* flag).

* *New settings were added to the Scene > Blend4Web panel.*

     The *Enable Object Outlining* option was added to control the
     overall possibility of outlining. Similarly, the new *Enable
     Object Selectable* option controls the overall possibility of
     objects' selection.

* *Now the following object properties: Apply Scale, Apply
  Modifiers, Export Vertex Animation, Export Edited Normals and Export
  Shape Keys are mutually exclusive.*

* *API changes in modules.*

     The new *is_armature* method was added to the API of the util.js
     module. It checks if the given object is of the "ARMATURE" type.

     The new *get_parent* method was added to the API of the
     constraints.js  module. It returns the parent object of the given
     object.


Fixes
-----

* *Fixed a bug in the "anchors.js" module which caused objects'
  descriptions to disappear.*

* *Fixed a bug in the Animation Baker script that occured when there
  were armature objects in hidden layers.*

* *Fixed the camera's behavior while using "append_semi_stiff_cam"
  method of the "constraints.js" module.*

     Fixed correction of the camera's vertical axis relative to the
     parent object. Also the original camera orientation is now being
     taken into account. This can require some adjusments of the
     camera's rotation limits that are passed to this function.

* *Fixed a bug with reloading of the playlist when it was empty.*

* *Fixed the buggy behavior of physical objects that occured after
  deleting at least one of them from the scene.*

* *Fixed a bug that occured when there were zero-scaled objects
  instanced through DupliGroups.*

* *Fixed a compilation error of the water shader occured on Windows
  and some mobile devices.*

* *Fixed a bug that occured when there were duplicates of animation
  keyframes.*

* *Actions from different files sharing one name can be now used for
  NLA animation.*

* *Fixed duplication of event listeners that occured when the
  "pointerlock" function was repeatedly called.*

* *Fixed behavior of the "Alpha sort" transparency type for dynamic
  objects.*

* *Fixed an add-on compilation error that occured on Windows without
  C++ 2010 runtime installed.*

* *Fixed a bug with rendering of billboard objects on iPad.*


v15.03
======


New Features
------------

* *New tool for adding annotations to 3D objects.*

     Now it is possible to assign anchors to empty objects. These
     anchors can be of three different types: "Annotations" -
     information from object's meta-tags is used, "Custom Element" - a
     custom HTML-element from the current web-page can be used as
     annotation, "Generic" - an invisible anchor with coordinates
     calculated using "anchors.js" module API.

* *Animation and API methods for Value and RGB nodes in node
  materials.*

     Now it is possible to animate not only "Value" nodes but also
     "RGB" nodes. Also, the corresponding API methods for changing
     such nodes were added in the "objects.js" module.

* *New "Code Snippets" application.*

     This application was created to simplify access to the examples
     of engine's functionality. It is also possible to look at the
     examples' scripts. This application can be launched from the
     index.html file located in the Blend4Web SDK's root directory.

* *New control functions for the Glow effect.*

     New APIs were added in the *scenes* module:
     *get_glow_intensity()* and *get_glow_color()*.

* *Improvements in the Scene Viewer.*

     Design of the "Home" button was changed. A new button "All
     objects selectable" was added. It allows to turn off automatic
     "Selectable" option assignment for all scene objects. Also, it is
     now possible to see the total number of shaders on the loaded
     scene.

* *Dynamic copying of scene objects (instancing).*

     Now it is possible to dynamically copy and remove scene objects
     (to create and remove instances).

* *Handling errors related to the B4W_PARALLAX Blend4Web-specific
  node.*

     In case of incorrect usage of the B4W_PARALLAX node, an export
     error warning is generated.

* *New options in the applications builder.*

     There are now new options in the application builder: "-j" and
     "-c". They add scripts and styles correspondingly to the
     exceptions in order to be not compiled.

* *Experimental Blend4Web render engine.*

     It can be turned on in the addon settings using the "Register
     Blend4Web render engine (Experimental)" flag. This mode is
     designed to simplify customization of scene properties. Also, it
     simplifies the interface by removing unsupported panels. At the
     moment, it is not possible to edit shader node tree in the
     Blend4Web render mode.


Changes
-------

* *Origin for counting off the camera limits has been changed.*

     Setting camera movement limits via API now perfectly corresponds
     to values measured in the engine's coordinate system. Setting
     horizontal limits for the "TARGET" camera in the Blender's world
     space has been changed. Thus, it may require changeovers for old
     scenes.

* *Documentation update for the camera settings.*

* *Horizontal and vertical limits of the camera rotation are
  completely independent from each other.*

* *Some APIs in the camera.js module were changed.*

     APIs of the "camera.js" module have undergone a number of
     changes.

     New methods were added: *is_target_camera*, *is_eye_camera*,
     *is_hover_camera*, *rotate_camera*, *rotate_target_camera*,
     *rotate_eye_camera*, *rotate_hover_camera*, *get_camera_angles*,
     *hover_cam_set_translation*.

     The following methods were declared as deprecated and will be
     removed in the next releases: *rotate_pivot*, *rotate_hover_cam*,
     *rotate*, *set_eye_params*, *get_angles*,
     *translate_hover_cam_v*, *set_hover_cam_angle*.

     The *set_ortho_scale* and *get_ortho_scale* methods now print
     error message when they are applied to the "Orthographic" camera.
     The behavior of the *get_hover_angle_limits* method was also
     changed. This method now returns angle limits for the "HOVER"
     camera in the [down, up] format instead of [up, down] as it was
     before.

* *The lighting system was significantly optimized.*

     Many of the lamp props are calculated at the compile time now.
     Now, there is no 4 lamp restriction is imposed for some mobile
     devices.

* *The HTML layout method was changed for apps using the app
  module.*

     Now, upon initializing an application using the "app.js" module,
     the dimensions of the created "<canvas>" element are completely
     determined by the size of the container element. Thus, if a
     "<div>" element is used as a container, the size of "<canvas>"
     will be zero by default since div's default size is zero. You can
     set correct params for the container with CSS and inline-style.
     Also, you have to use *resize_to_container()* method from the
     *app* module when the container is changed. The same effect may
     be achieved if the *autoresize* option is set upon initializing
     the application (in the *app.init()* function). The low level
     method for changing the element's dimensions with *main.resize()*
     function is still supported.

* *Now, the enable_controls() function from the app module should be
  called without any params.*

* *Deprecated API methods were removed.*

     textures.js module : *stop_video*.

     scenes.js module: *add_object*, *get_screen_scenes*,
     *set_light_pos*, *set_light_direction*, *set_dir_light_color*,
     *get_lights_names*, *remove_all*, *check_collision*,
     *check_ray_hit*, *get_appended_objs*, *get_object_by_empty_name*.

     physics.js module: *set_character_dist_to_water*.

     material.js module: *set_batch_param*, *set_max_bones*,
     *max_bones*.

     main.js module: *set_shaders_dir*, *set_texture_quality*.

     data.js module: *get_bpy_world*.

     controls.js module: *sensor_make_positive*,
     *sensor_make_negative*.

     camera.js module: *change_eye_target_dist* (deprecated
     *MS_CONTROLS* was also removed).

* *There are now new conditions to allow changing object's position
  via API.*

     The functions from the "transform.js" module related to changing
     object position can be now applied to dynamic objects only.

* *You can now use TEXTURE nodes without textures.*

     In this case the rendering of the node material completely
     corresponds to Blender.

* *Updated the procedure of compatibility checks for versions of
  exported files and the engine itself.*

     The engine will report about the scene's incompatibility by
     printing messages in the browser console.

* *The  "Do Not Batch" property was renamed to "Force Dynamic
  Object"*

     This option instructs the engine that the object must be dynamic
     regardless of other settings. Now its name is more clear.


Fixes
-----

* *Fixed camera autorotate feature of the web player.*

* *Fixed an error related to the fullscreen mode in the Web Player.*

* *Fixed an error related to the determination of the camera's
  angular coordinates in some positions.*

  are enabled.*

* *Fixed an error when Blend4Web-specific nodes were being added
  multiple times to a .blend file.*

* *Fixed a bug with replacing materials by using the
  "inherit_material" function from the "material.js" module.*

* *Fixed an error occured while rendering reflections on an object
  which has been changed through the "material.js" module APIs.*

* *Fixed generation of the debugging wireframe spheres.*

* *Fixed optimization of the TEXTURE nodes in node materials.*

* *Fixed "Clamp" option behavior in the MixRGB (Linear Light) node.*

* *Fixed an export error occured when an object shares its mesh with
  another object and one of the following flags is set to true: "Apply
  Scale", "Apply Modifiers", "Export Vertex Animation" or "Export
  Edited Normals".*

* *Fixed an error with "Blend4Web > Preserve Global Orientation and
  Scale" option on some mobile devices.*

* *Fixed fog rendering error in some versions of Chrome/Firefox
  under Windows.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Video textures do not work in Firefox for scenes exported as HTML
  files.*


v15.02
======


New Features
------------

* *The local development server can be run from Blender.*

     It's possible now to run local development server when using
     Blend4Web SDK. This server allows fast access to the Blend4Web
     SDK content and also make it possible to automatically open
     exported scenes in the Viewer application.

* *Support for Spot lights shadows.*

     Shadows for Spot lamps were processed in the same way as for Sun
     lamps. Now the calculations are performed in the same way as it's
     done in blender i.e the light scattering is taken into account.

* *Added/improved support for "Metaball", "Surface" and "Curve"
  objects.*

     Support for "Metaball", "Surface" and "Curve" objects was added.
     Objects of these types are automatically converted into meshes
     during export. Support for "Curve" objects in modifiers was
     preserved.

* *Social networks buttons are added to the Web Player.*

     These buttons allow placing a link and a description to the 3D
     scene in one of the four popular social networks.

* *Added support for editing the list of Viewer scenes directly in
  Blender.*

     It is now possible to edit assets.json file with a list of Viewer
     scenes inside Blender. This works only when using Blend4Web SDK.

* *Screenshots can now be taken in the Viewer application.*

* *New fallback_video option is added to the Web Player.*

     Now the user can choose a video file to play instead of 3D
     content on systems without WebGL support. It is possible with the
     help of the new "fallback_video=/path/to/video/" option.

* *Improved rendering to texture functionality.*

     Added support for rendering scenes into several textures at a
     time. Scenes now can have any nesting level.

* *Billboards now can save orientation and scale in world
  coordinates.*

     To use the feature you need to set Blend4Web > Preserve global
     orientation and scale flag in the object's settings panel.

* *Improvements on the main SDK web page.*

     It is now possible to find out the version of the SDK and check
     the system for WebGL compatibility on the main web page.

* *Added support for the Clamp flag in MATH and MIX_RGB nodes*

     At first this functionality was released in Blender 2.73, and now
     it's also supported in the engine.

* *Considerable imporovements in rendering quality on systems
  without depth-texture support.*

     Supported rendering features on systems without depth-texture
     support were extended. There are such effects available now:
     reflections, bloom, glow, motion blur, antialiasing.

* *New documentation is added.*

     Added documentation for the "vec3", "vec4", "quat", "mat3",
     "mat4" modules and for the global namespace "b4w". Documentation
     web pages design was improved.

* *Support for several engine instances on the same web page.*

     Several engine instances can now work simultaniously, by
     specifying the namespace on engine's initialization stage.

* *Possibility to use SDK on Apple OS X.*

     On OS X all SDK functionality including engine and applications
     building, resource conversation and documentation generation is
     now available.

* *The new set_trans_pivot() method is added to the camera module.*

     This function allows setting an arbitrary position of the pivot
     point and the position of the camera of the "Target" type.

* *A new ``version`` property is added to the ``project.py``
  utility.*

     This property allows adding a version to the scripts and styles
     of the compiled application.


Changes
-------

* *Now it is possible to add options with the same names via browser
  address bar.*

     A new optional parameter "allow_param_array" is added to
     "get_url_params()" function of "app" module. It is set to "false"
     by default. Setting this parameter to "true" leads to a merge of
     identical functions into a massive, other way the last one will
     be used.

* *Improved ``Background Music`` speaker.*

     Now the user can specify parameters of delay and playback time.

* *Blend-file now includes special Blend4Web nodes by default.*

     Now there's no need to add Blend4Web special nodes into a file.
     It is available in both SDK and addon versions of Blend4Web.

* *Changed export of empty "Mesh" objects.*

     Now "Mesh" objects without polygons are exported as "Empty".

* *Changed "light.js" module.*

     Added function "get_light_type"; functions "get_light_params" and
     "set_light_params" now get object "LAMP" instead of objects name.
     Also the user now can change "spot_blend", "spot_size" and
     "distance" properties of the "SPOT" light source through those
     functions.

* *Improved refractions on LOW quality settings.*

     New simplified (without distortion) refraction model is now used
     when "LOW" quality is chosen.

* *Shader nodes optimization.*

* *Now automatic camera rotation can be turned off by touching touch
  screen.*


Fixes
-----

* *Corrected behavior of the preloader for the Web Player.*

     Some artifacts could be visible on "B4W" logo while opening Web
     Player.

* *Fixed an error in rendering of one-cascaded shadows. The error
  was related to appearing of a hard non-lighted line on the cascade
  border.*

* *Fixed an error related to names collision while linking objects
  in Blender.*

* *Fixed an error with optimization of SDK apps.*

* *Fixed export error of flat shaded meshes on Linux x32.*

* *Fixed incorrect behavior of Target camera in particular cases.*

* *Fixed an error when using a shadow map with size exceeding device
  limits.*

* *Fixed an error that leads to FPS drop in Firefox 35/36 on Windows
  when shadows are turned ON.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Video textures do not work in Firefox for scenes exported as HTML
  files.*


v15.01
======


New Features
------------

* *Support for panning on touchscreen devices.*

     Panning is performed by swiping two fingers on the surface of the
     screen.

* *Support for "Text" objects.*

     These objects are now automatically converted to meshes during
     export.

* *Extended support for the NLA Script tool.*

     Added new logic slots: "Show Object" and "Hide Object" used for
     hiding and showing the obects, "Page Redirect" - for redirecting
     to other webpages , "Page Param" - for storing any webpage
     parameter in given numerical register. Simplified usage of
     "Select & Jump" and "Select & Play" slots. Now it's not required
     to specify "Selectable" property on selectable objects.

* *Support for high definition displays (HIDPI, Retina).*

     The HIDPI mode allows to achieve considerable improvement of
     picture quality on devices with high resolution. This mode is
     activated automatically upon application startup if ULTRA quality
     profile has been selected. If necessary, high resolution can be
     turned on for other quality profiles.

* *Support orthographic camera scaling.*

     An API to change the "Orthographic" camera scale has been added
     ("Orthographic scale" in Blender).

* *"autorotate" option has been added to the webplayer.*

     The option autorotate is used to turn on the automatic camera
     rotation as soon as the scene loads.

* *Simplied keyboard control mode has been added to function
  "enable_camera_controls.*

     The mode is enabled by passing the optional parameter
     "disable_letter_controls" Thus, the keyboard controls with letter
     keys (WASD and so on) will be turned off.This feature can be used
     in cases when you need to use the letter keys for purposes other
     than moving the camera.

* *Support for gyroscope on mobile devices.*

     To work with gyroscope on mobile devices the two sensors was
     implemented. The first sensor allows to operate with current
     device position compared with the previous one (position delta).
     It's created by using the function "create_gyro_delta_sensor"
     from "controls.js" module. The second sensor returns current
     device angle and created by "create_gyro_angles_sensor" from
     "controls.js" module. It's worth to mention that all angles are
     given in radians. Also the special addon "gyroscope.js" was
     created. This addon implements simple camera movements due to
     device rotation. You can find an example of using such feature in
     our Viewer application by selecting the "Gyroscope" menu option.

* *New ``Do not Render`` property has been added to material
  settings.*

     Enabling the property allows to hide parts of the scene objects
     which use such material.

* *Support for video-textures on IE 11 and iPhone.*

     The support is achieved by creating a new video-sequence format,
     "*.seq". For more info check the following topic in
     documentation.

* *Support for "title" tag in Web Player.*

     The Web Player's title (shown as web browser header) is now
     extracted from JSON file of the loaded scene. For more info about
     this feature check the following topic in documentation.

* *Support for meta tags in Blender.*

     It's now possible to append meta tag information to scenes and
     objects in Blender. Possible tags for scenes are "title" and
     "description". Possible tags for objects are "title",
     "description" and "category".

* *Added support for execution of user-defined functions every
  frame.*

     To help users to create sophisticated application the new
     function "append_loop_cb" has been added to "main.js" module.
     This function allows to execute given callback every frame. This
     callback has two parameters: time since the application start and
     time delta between current and previous frame. Both parameters
     are in seconds. To cancel the callback execution every frame you
     should remove it by using the "remove_loop_cb" function from the
     module "main.js".

* *Added support for simple preloader screen animation.*

     To create an application with animated preloader pass an option
     "preloader_fadeout" with the value "true" to the function
     "create_simple_preloader" from "preloader.js" module.

* *Added support to export converted media files to HTML file.*

     Now then you export HTML files it's possible to store converted
     files in them. To do so you need to enable "Export Converted
     Media" option in the export options.

* *Added support for using min50 and dds textures in Web Player.*

     To enable this feature pass "compressed_textures" parameter to
     Web Player.


Changes
-------

* *SDK file hierarchy was simplified.*

     The "external" directory was removed, all its content was moved
     to the upper level - in the root directory of the SDK. The file
     with the list of the scenes used by the Viewer application is now
     located in "apps_dev/viewer" directory.

* *Changed camera autorotation behavior (experimental).*

     If the camera limits are present, the camera smoothly slows down
     when approaching the limits, then moves in the opposite
     direction.

* *The usage of ``Special: Collision`` property was changed.*

     Earlier, enabling the option automatically resulted in objects'
     hiding. Now, to do the same thing, you have to specify "Do not
     Render" property in the material settings.

* *Changed suffix for converted media files.*

     Old "*.lossconv.*" suffix was replaced by "*.altconv.*".

* *Behavior of "Do not render" object property was changed.*

     Now, when the option is activated, an object's physics is not
     disabled. The object simply becomes invisible.

* *Improved the SDK structure.*

     Free and Pro SDK now come with the new and more polished
     examples; old and arid examples were dropped.


Fixes
-----

* *When using "Panoramic" camera type in Blender the camera
  automatically obtains "Perspective" type when exported.*

* *Fixed bug with "Target" camera dragging in rare cases.*

* *Minor fixes in the "B4W Anim Baker" addon.*

* *Fixed issue with sound for scenes with multiple cameras.*

* *Improved stability of "Timer" sensors in "controls" module.*

* *Fixed issue when browsing exported HTMLs in IE browser.*

* *Video texture optimizations. Now the video texture is not updated
  for suspended video playback.*

* *Fixed rendering issue in node materials with ``REFRACTION``
  node.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Video textures do not work in Firefox for scenes exported as HTML
  files.*

* *Slow and unstable rendering of depth textures in Firefox 35.*

     In various scenes the FPS is degraded when shadows are turned on.
     There is also an incorrect rendering of transparent materials.
     The issue is reported here and is to be fixed in the future
     browser updates.


v14.12
======


New Features
------------

* *Camera velocity settings are now available.*

     Now camera movement velocity can be set up, including
     translation, rotation and zooming. Velocity for all camera types
     ("Target", "Hover", "Eye") can be tweaked both using Blender UI
     and through Blend4Web API.

* *Mipmapping is now supported for Canvas textures.*

     We have added mipmapping support for Canvas textures.

* *Full support for the "MAPPING" node.*

     Now all "Vector type" options available for the "MAPPING" node
     are supported, including "Texture", "Point", "Vector" and
     "Normal".

* *Glow on mouse over.*

     API in the "mouse.js" module were created for the effect of
     outlining the objects under the mouse pointer. Also, for purposes
     of controlling this effect, "enable_mouse_hover_glow()" and
     "disable_mouse_hover_glow()" methods were added. The objects
     should have "Object > Blend4Web > Selectable" checkbox enabled.

* *A brand new app building system.*

     Now, the users can develop their apps right in the SDK thanks to
     the new "project.py" utility. This script makes it possible to
     build the apps together with the engine, to minify JavaScript and
     CSS files and to export the final apps to be deployed on a
     server.


Changes
-------

* *Removed support for deprecated "UV translation velocity" texture
  settings.*

     We recommend to use node materials instead.

* *Removed deprecated "Levels of Detail" user interface.*

     This functionality can be used through Blender's standard "Levels
     of Detail" tool.

* *The pointerlock.js add-on was renamed into mouse.js.*

* *A mouseup event is now fired when the mouse pointer is leaving
  the app viewport.*

     So the problem with broken camera controls is no longer observed.

* *Error message about "Clear parent inverse" is no more shown.*

     Before, when using parenting, it was required to reset
     translation, rotation and scale of child objects ("Object >
     Parent > Clear Parent Inverse"). Now such transformation is
     natively supported by the engine.

* *"Apply scale" option no longer applies modifiers.*

     As before, Apply modifiers should be used in order to apply
     modifiers.

* *Use of normal maps in node materials no longer requires a
  Material or Extended Material node.*

     In some cases (e.g. refraction) normal maps can be used in
     shadeless materials.


Fixes
-----

* *Fixed audio playback error occured when using NLA.*

     This happened due to insufficient float number precision.

* *Fixed incorrect rendering of light sources on mobile devices.*

* *Layering shadows is fixed when multiple active light sources are
  present.*

     Now the shadows are calculated like in Blender, that is areas
     illuminated by other light sources are not darkened.

* *Node material rendering error has been fixed.*

     The error occured when a "MATERIAL" node (or "MATERIAL_EXT") with
     a linked (from another .blend file) material was used.

* *Animation baker ("B4W Animation Bake" operator) no longer resets
  an armature pose.*

     Now, when using the animation baking tool, the armature pose is
     being left intact.

* *Fixed jerky camera movement upon application startup.*

* *Fixed error with incorrect determination of the camera's
  horizontal movement limits.*

* *Fixed error occured when unused textures were exported.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Video textures do not work in Firefox for scenes exported as HTML
  files.*


v14.11
======


New Features
------------

* *Video textures support.*

     Video textures are now supported for "Image or Movie" textures.

* *Frame rate.*

     Frame rate for animation and video textures can now be changed
     through the "Scene > Dimensions > Frame rate" option.

* *Canvas textures support.*

     A canvas HTML element can be now used as a texture. The workflow
     is described in the manual.

* *Сamera panning.*

     In the mode when the camera is rotating around a single point
     ("Target") the users now have the ability to move the pivot point
     within the view plane (so called camera panning) while the right
     or middle mouse buttons are pressed. This function is turned on
     by default and can be turned off in Blender settings at need.

* *New camera control mode - Hover.*

     The "Hover" mode is now available when the camera is gliding over
     the horizontal plane (including zooming in and out). This camera
     mode makes it possible to realize scenarios for a convenient
     viewing of scenes which are spread in two dimensions (rooms, game
     levels).

* *The SDK now contains a root index.html webpage for simplifying
  navigation within the distribution.*

* *The resource converter now has the ability to convert videos.*

* *We have added a build system which was absent in previous public
  SDK distributions.*

* *The export Strict mode is implemented in the add-on.*

     Activating "Strict mode" gives the possibility to display all
     possible errors and warnings connected with incorrect scene
     settings. The option is useful for final scene debugging for
     getting the most correct and optimized resource files.

* *Audio playback support for iOS devices.*


Changes
-------

* *The webplayer's "bg" parameter is renamed to "fallback_image".*

     This option also has changed its behavior. If the
     "fallback_image" is defined the error message that WebGL is
     unavailable is not shown any more, instead the user sees just the
     image.

* *If there are no sound sources in the scene the sound mute button
  is no longer shown in the webplayer.*

* *Generic materials workflow is now more predictable.*

* *The "mouse_down" sensor provides the code of the mouse button
  pressed. This code can be obtained from the payload sensor's
  parameter.*

* *Hair particle systems can be now exported significantly faster.*


Fixes
-----

* *Normal maps now work with Generated and Normal texture
  coordinates.*

     Using UV layers is no more required for normal maps.

* *Fixed the problem with the wrong path to the physics engine in
  the webplayer.*

     This error arose when uranium.js was moved out of the directory
     containing the main HTML file of the webplayer.

* *In the add-on we have fixed the problem with packed textures.
  Export crashed when the "Automatically Pack Into .blend" option was
  enabled.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).


v14.10
======


New Features
------------

* *A new Web Player.*

     The new minimalistic Web Player design blends perfectly with any
     3D scenes. It has a simplified user interface and build-in help.
     The Web Player works on all devices including mobile ones.

* *Improved shadows.*

     It's now possible to choose a non-cascaded shadow model, based on
     a single optimized shadow map. Such model is easier to configure
     and suits well for relatively small scenes. For more info see the
     docs.

* *Many NLA system improvements.*

     It's now possible to create a complex logic using the
     "Conditional Jump", "Register Store", "Math Operation" NLA Script
     logic blocks and register-stored variables.

     It's now possible to use all types of supported animations in the
     NLA, including sound playback, vertex animation and particle
     emission. It's now possible to play different animation types
     simultaneously.

* *Supported objects billboarding.*

     The objects received the new set of options, allowing to
     configure billboarding.

* *The "XYZ Euler" mode is supported for animating rotations.*

     Object and skeletal animations now support the "XYZ Euler" mode
     for rotations.

* *Support for the GENERATED texture coordinates.*

* *Support for Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).*

* *Scene export process simplified.*

     The range of material export errors are now not blocking the
     export. Instead this material will be highlighted pink at scene
     loading. Detailed error descriptions can be found in the manual.

* *Added support for the "Do not export" option for particle
  systems.*

* *Improved stability on iOS devices.*


Changes
-------

* *Changed SDK path setting for HTML export.*

     It's now needed to set the SDK path setting for HTML export to
     SDK root directory. Earlier it was required to provide the full
     path to embed application. Pay attention, the old behavior is not
     supported anymore.

* *Deprecated the "UV translation velocity" option.*

     The option will be removed since version 14.12.

* *Removed option "Do not export" from the "Object data" panel.*

* *Removed "Blend4Web > Animation > Cyclic" option from the object
  properties panel*.

     Instead one should use "Blend4Web > Animation > Behavior" option
     located in the same place. Scenes with default animations may
     work incorrectly, so they need behavior property to be set to
     "Cyclic".

* *Modified SSAO algorythm realisation.*

     The new implementation is much faster and shows better quality.
     The settings of the algorithm are changed too. For more info see
     the manual section.


Fixes
-----

* *Fixed rendering error for HALO materials.*

* *Fixed a rendering error when an object with the enabled "Force
  Dynamic Object" property has a parent object.*

* *Fixed error with keyboard shortcuts in Blender.*

     Fixed error with inability to assign keyboard shortcuts in
     Blender for export menu items:"File->Export->Blend4Web(.json)"
     and "File->Export->Blend4Web(.html)".

* *Fixed crash when loading textures with size exceeding device
  limits.*

* *Fixed node material errors resulting in unstable engine
  behavior*.

* *Fixed error in node materials that contained complex Node
  Groups.*

* *Fixed errors of shaders compilation on devices with mobile
  graphics Qualcomm Adreno 305.*

* *Fixed rendering error when using REFRACTION nodes in transparent
  meterials.*

* *Fixed an issue in "B4W Vertex Anim Baker" tool when current frame
  reset was occured after using bake.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Normal maps don't work for Generated texture type.*

     It is necessary to use UV mapping for normal maps.


v14.09
======


New Features
------------

* *ABSOLUTE type support for the MATH node.*

* *Support for LEVELS_OF_QUALITY special node.*

     Allows to control the material's complexity depending on the
     quality profile which is specified by the user upon engine start.

* *Support for SMOOTHSTEP special node.*

     Simplifies the creation of some effects in node materials.

* *Node groups support.*

     Node groups allow the sharing of node blocks between materials.

* *The ability to output intermediate rendering results for
  debugging.*

     The rendering result for a certain stage can be now output above
     the main picture. This can be set up in the "config.js" module
     through the "debug_subs" options.

* *The logic for controling Blender's NLA animation using a visual
  editor has been implemented.*

     The NLA Script tool has been added to Blender's interface to
     allow the implementing of simple scenarios using visual blocks,
     for example playing an animation in response to the user actions.

* *Multiple sensor system improvements.*

     It is now permitted to register *sensor manifolds* globally using
     a "controls" module method with no connection to any object. To
     do this "null" should be passed into the corresponding API. The
     sensor logic is processed in a more predictable and robust way
     according to the sequence in which their *manifolds* are created.
     Callbacks of the user action events are now assigned using the
     "register_<inputtype>_events()" functions. To these functions it
     is now possible to pass the "prevent_default" flag which allows
     to unblock the standard browser behavior for the corresponding
     events.

* *The Web Player now supports physics.*

     Works only in the Web Player version where JSON files are loaded
     separately. Physics still not supported in the single HTML files.

* *Skeletal animation mixing is now supported.*

     The "animation.js" module now contains API for smooth transitions
     betweeen skeletal animations: get_skel_mix_factor() - for getting
     the current mixing factor value and set_skel_mix_factor() - for
     setting it.

* *The Value node can now be animated in node materials.*

     The functionality is similar to other animation types. Working in
     NLA is also supported.

* *Diffuse and Specular lamp's properties are now supported.*

* *The possibility to render a transparent object above other
  objects on the scene.*

     Activated with the "Render above all" checkbox for transparent
     materials (i.e. not "Opaque").

* *Scale is applied automatically to the object mesh.*

     Activated by enabling the "Apply scale" checkbox in the object
     settings.

* *High quality profile (including shadows, dynamic reflections and
  anti-aliasing) has been implemented for iOS.*


Changes
-------

* *Shadow rendering improved.*

     Shadow rendering system is significantly changed: it is now based
     on the "Stable Cascaded Shadow Maps" technique. This technique
     allows to greatly diminish the flickering of shadow edges when
     the camera moves. Smoothing is implemented between cascades. Also
     shadows of the last cascade fade out at distancing. Softened
     shadows are rendered using the "Percentage Closer Shadows"
     technique. The shadows' user settings are reworked and
     simplified. Now its possible to tweak the size of shadow maps,
     blur ratio and the setting for removing self-shadowing artefacts.
     The new settings are documented in detail.

* *In the Web Player graphics quality settings are now saved
  independently for each scene.*

* *The behavior of the app configuration parameters has been
  changed: physics_uranium_path, smaa_search_texture_path and
  smaa_area_texture_path.*

     These parameters are now calculated automatically depending on
     the running HTML files location, if they haven't been overriden
     during the app's initialization.

* *Transition is completed to the system of modules which are linked
  via b4w.require() call.*

     This also means that starting form the current version its
     impossible to call modules in the engine's release version using
     the old "b4w.<module>" namespaces. For compatibility purposes the
     "ns_compat.js" add-on has been implemeted, the linking of which
     allows to restore the old behavior.

* *The Web Player's control panel can now be hidden.*

* *Skeletal animation is now applied to armature objects only.*

     There is no need to apply skeletal animation to "MESH" objects.
     If they are linked to some animated armature, their skinning will
     be automatic.

* *Demos and tutorials are updated according to the newly
  implemented features.*


Fixes
-----

* *The preloader didn't diappear in case of a loading error (texture
  or sound file).*

* *Lagging during scaling and turning on mobile devices is fixed.*

* *TARGET-type camera shimmering has been removed for small
  turnings.*

* *EYE-type camera controls was fixed for mobile devices.*

* *The Farm demo controls are improved for Safari browser.*

* *Errors concerning using the unsupported shading models in node
  materials are now fixed.*

* *"Selectable" option now works for the objects without materials.*

* *There is no longer need to enable "Force Dynamic Object"* for the
  objects that are animated using NLA.

* *The particle system error when the object being instanced is
  parented to another object, has been fixed.*


Known Issues
------------

* *Blender add-on upgrading problems.*

     We strongly don't recommend to install the new Blender add-on
     version without uninstalling the previous version first
     (especially for Windows).

* *Armature animation mixing doesn't work with some browsers.*

     If skeletal animation mixing API brings unexpected errors, it is
     neccessary to override standard Math.sign function as follows:

        var m_util  = require("util");
        Math.sign = m_util.sign;
