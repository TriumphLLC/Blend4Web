Particle System. Fluids
***********************

The particle system is intended to visualize phenomena which are
caused by the movement of numerous small objects such as smoke, fire,
water splashes and other.

A particle system requires an emitter - an object which defines the
location and the direction of the outgoing particles flow.


Usage
=====


Necessary steps
---------------

1. Add a mesh emitter to the scene.

2. Create a material for particles on the emitter, for example of
   the "Halo" type. The "Surface" material type with a mandatory
   diffuse texture is also supported.

3. Add a particle system on the emitter.

4. Initiate the engine playback. Two options are available:

      * "cyclic emission" - enable the "Emission > Cyclic emission"
        option for the particle system.

      * "non-cyclic animation" - enable the "Animation > Apply
        Default Animation" option for the emitter.


Recommended additional settings
-------------------------------

1. Set the "Add" transparency type for the particles' material.

2. Disable emitter rendering if needed using the "Particles >
   Render > Emitter" checkbox.

3. If an emitter is required on a scene use additional materials
   for it. In this case select the particles' material in the
   "Particles > Render > Material" menu on the particles settings
   panel.

4. If the "Surface" material type is used it is required to add a
   diffuse texture (normally with the alpha channel) to this material.
   Select  "UV" in the "Mapping > Coordinates" menu.  Make sure that
   the emitter's mesh has a UV layer.

Setup
=====

The particle system parameters can be set up under the "Particles"
tab. Multiple particle systems per emitter are supported.

Basic settings
--------------

*Name*
   Particle system name. The default name is "ParticleSystem".

*Settings*
   Reference to the settings datablock of the particle system. The
   datablock settings can be shared between different particle
   systems.

*Type*
   Particle system type: "Emitter" or "Hair". "Hair" particle systems
   can be used to create numerous copies of an object (so called
   instancing). The default is "Emitter".

*Seed*
   Index in the table of random numbers which are used for particle
   system generation. The default value is 0.


Emission settings
-----------------

*Emission > Number*
   Number of particles. The default value is 1000.

*Emission > Start*
   The first frame after which the emission of particles starts. The
   default value is 1.0.

*Emission > End*
   The last frame after which the emission of particles ends. The
   default value is 200.0.

*Emission > Lifetime*
   The life time of particles measured in frames. The default value is
   50.0.

*Emission > Lifetime > Random*
   The random factor for the life time. The default value is 0.0.

*Emission > Emit From*
   Emission source type. The following types are supported: "Verts"
   (emit from vertices), "Faces" (emit from polygons). The default is
   "Faces".

*Emission > Cyclic emission*
   The option enables the cyclic emission mode. It can be used for
   permanent effects (such as smoke, burning, water splashes). It is
   recommended to set the "Emission > Start" value to zero. Disabled
   by default.

*Emission > Random Delay*
   The option enables a random emission time for particles. Disabled
   by default.

*Emission > Emit From > Distribution*
   Emission distribution settings: "Jittered", "Random", "Grid".
   Ignored by the engine. Internally the engine always uses "Random"
   distribution. The default is "Jittered".

Direction settings
------------------

*Velocity > Emitter Geometry > Normal*
   Factor influencing the emission along the emitter's mesh normals.
   The default value is 1.0.

*Velocity > Other > Random*
   Factor of randomization for emission direction. The default value
   is 0.0.


Rotation settings
-----------------

*Rotation > Angular Velocity > Mode*
   Mode for particle billboards self-rotating. "Hair" particle system
   supports all the types of rotation and "Emitter" supports only
   "Velocity".

*Rotation > Angular Velocity > Factor*
   Factor of rotation velocity for particle billboards. The default
   value is 0.0.


Physics settings
----------------

*Physics > Type*
   Physics calculation type: "No", "Newtonian", "Keyed", "Boids",
   "Fluid". Ignored by the engine. "Newtonian" physics is always used.
   The default is "Newtonian".

*Physics > Size*
   Particle size. The default value is 0.05.

*Physics > Mass*
   Particle mass. Affects interaction with force fields (such as
   wind). The default value is 1.0.

*Physics > Forces > Brownian*
   Exported but not used by the engine.

Rendering settings
------------------

*Render > Material*
   Menu for selecting the particle's material. Used for referencing to
   the particle' material in case multiple materials are used by the
   emitter. The default value is "Default Material".

*Render > Emitter*
   Enables emitter rendering on the scene. Enabled by default.

*Render > Type*
   Particle rendering mode: "None", "Halo", "Line", "Path", "Object",
   "Group", "Billboard". The engine supports the "Object" and the
   "Group" modes which are used for objects and groups instancing
   respectively. Other modes are ignored. It is recommended to use the
   "Billboard" mode for convenient display of billboards. The default
   is "Halo".

*Render > Billboard align*
   The way billboards are oriented: "View" - follow the camera, "XY
   plane", "YZ plane", "ZX plane" - align to the corresponding plane
   (in the world coordinate system of Blender). The default is "View".

Render > Dissolve intervals > Fade-in* and *Fade-out*
   Starting and ending intervals (measured in frames) for gradually
   increasing and decreasing the particles' transparency.

*Render > Coordinate system*
   Coordinate system of emitting particles: "Local" - use local
   coordinate system of the emitter object, "World" - use world
   coordinate system.

*Render > Soft Particles*
   Support for soft particles, billboards of which smoothly dissolve
   when contacting with surfaces. Use the "Particle Softness" slider
   to tweak this effect.


Supported settings for force fields influence
---------------------------------------------

*Field Weights > Gravity*
   Gravity influence factor (Earth's attraction). The default value is
   1.0.

*Field Weights > Wind*
   Wind influence factor. A "Wind" force field source should be
   present (can be added using "Add > Force Field"). A particle system
   is also influenced by the wind direction and strength. The default
   value is 1.0.


Engine specific settings
------------------------

*Export Options > Do not export*
   Don't export.


Textures in Particle Systems
============================


Textures of the particle's material
-----------------------------------

For the "Surface" particle's materials it is **required** to have a
diffuse texture (normally with an alpha-channel). In the "Mapping >
Coordinates" menu choose the "UV" option.  Make sure that the
emitter's mesh has a UV layer.

For the "Halo" particle's materials it is **possible** to use a
"Blend" texture with a "Linear" gradient. In the "Mapping >
Coordinates" menu choose the "Strand / Particle" option. It is
required to enable "Ramp" on a texture. Up to 4 gradient control
points are supported.

Textures of particle systems
----------------------------

Textures can also be used for setting up the behaviour of particle
systems. Unlike textures for particle materials such textures belong
to the particle system datablock, not to the material datablock. To
create a texture for the particle system it is required to go **from**
the "Particles" tab to the "Textures" tab and then to click the "New"
button.

The only supported type of textures is "Blend" with a "Linear"
gradient. "Ramp" should be enabled on the texture. Up to 4 gradient
control points are supported.

On the "Influence" panel choose the parameter which is influenced by
the texture. At the moment the only supported parameter is "Size".
