**********

scenes in a demonstration mode.

Usage
=====

You can copy the directory containing the web player files, namely
"deploy/apps/webplayer", from the Blend4Web SDK distribution and
deploy it on your web site. You can place the exported scene files on
your web site and specify the path to them (absolute or relative) with
the "load" web player parameter.

When you export into a single HTML file the web player interface is
integrated automatically into it.


Navigation
==========

The camera (in the "Target" and "Eye" modes) is controlled by the
mouse with it's button pressed or with the keys: "W", "A", "S", "D",
"R", "F" (forward, left, back, right, up, down). The "numpad" keys are
also supported.


Control Panel

Attributes

1. the special attribute "load" is used to load the scene, this
   attribute contains relative path to a JSON file.

2. in case of a WebGL error the optional "fallback_image" attribute
   is used to setup the background image instead of 3D content.

3. in case of a WebGL error the optional "fallback_video" attribute
   is used to setup the background video instead of 3D content. Can be
   used many times to add more video formats.

4. the optional "show_fps" attribute is used to display the FPS
   counter in the player's top right corner.

5. optional parameter "autorotate" is used to enable automatic
   camera rotation just after the scene loads.

6. the "compressed_textures" optional parameter is used to enable
   loading of minified and compressed textures (in DDS format).

7. optional "alpha" parameter is used to enable transparency for
   the rendering area.

Note: If both "fallback_image" and "fallback_video" parameters are
  specified, the "fallback_image" parameter is used.


Scene Name as Title
===================

By default the Web Player has the "Blend4Web Web Player" title.
Assigning the meta tag "title" on the scene in Blender you can change
that value to something else.

Scene Errors
============

If the player is used incorrectly it displays the corresponding
errors.

   the file is corrupt;
