Usage
-----

You can copy the directory containing the web player files, namely
``deploy/apps/webplayer``, from the Blend4Web SDK distribution and deploy it
on your website. You can place the exported scene files on your website
and specify the path to them (absolute or relative) with the ``load`` web
player parameter.

When you export into a single HTML file the web player interface is
integrated automatically into it.


Navigation
----------

The camera (in the ``Target`` and ``Eye`` modes) is controlled by the mouse
with its button pressed or with the keys: ``W``, ``A``, ``S``, ``D``,
``R``, ``F`` (forward, left, back, right, up, down). The ``numpad`` keys are
also supported.

Control Panel
-------------

The web player's control panel is shown below.

Attributes
----------

Web player accepts attributes from the browser address line:

1) the special attribute ``load`` is used to load the scene, this attribute contains relative path to a JSON file.
2) in case of a WebGL error the optional ``fallback_image`` attribute is used to setup the background image instead of 3D content.
3) in case of a WebGL error the optional ``fallback_video`` attribute is used to setup the background video instead of 3D content.
   Can be used many times to add more video formats.
4) the optional ``show_fps`` attribute is used to display the FPS counter in the player's top right corner.
5) optional parameter ``autorotate`` is used to enable automatic camera rotation just after the scene loads.
6) the ``compressed_textures`` optional parameter is used to enable loading of minified and compressed textures (in DDS format).
7) optional ``alpha`` parameter is used to enable transparency for the rendering area.
8) the optional ``no_social`` attribute is used to disable social networks buttons on the control panel.

.. note::

   If both ``fallback_image`` and ``fallback_video`` parameters are specified, the ``fallback_image`` parameter is used.

.. _wp_title:

Scene Name as Title
-------------------

By default the Web Player has the ``Blend4Web Web Player`` title. Assigning the meta tag ``title`` on the scene in Blender you can change that value to something else.

Scene Errors
------------

If the player is used incorrectly it displays the corresponding errors.


1) the ``load`` attribute specifies a wrong path to the JSON file or the file is corrupt;

2) the ``load`` attribute is not found or is void;
