Outdoor Rendering
*****************


Water
=====


Activation
----------

For the supposed water material activate the "Water" panel option
under the "Material" tab.

[image]


Basic Settings
--------------

*Transparency*
   It is recommended to enable the gradient transparency "Transparency
   > Alpha Blend" and to tweak the "Alpha" value.

*Lighting parameters*
   Lighting parameters for the water material can be set up as
   described in the Lighting Parameters section.


Waves Dynamics
--------------

Ripples on the water are simulated by normal maps with animated UVs
(from 0 up to 4 pieces). For normal map the only shared image is used
- the textures differs only by the "Mapping > Size" parameters. The
water mesh must have a UV layer.


Surface Wetting
---------------

Is carried out automatically. To turn the effect on activate the
"Wettable" option on the needed materials "Rendering Options" panel.


Reflection and Fresnel Effect
-----------------------------

For the water material both static and dynamic reflection is supported
as well as the Fresnel effect. See the Reflection section.

[image]


Shoreline Smoothing
-------------------

The effect affects the water near the shoreline - it becomes more
transparent.

*Water > Shore Smoothing*
   Enable smoothing.

*Water > Absorb Factor*
   Light absorption coefficient for the water. The higher it is the
   more transparent is the water.


Color Gradient
--------------

For color gradient the water material must have a texture with the
"Export Options > Shore Distance Map" option enabled. This texture can
be generated using the script for baking shoreline parameters

*Shallow water > Color*
   Shallow water color.

*Shallow water > Factor*
   Shallow water color mixing factor.

*Shore water > Color*
   Water color just at the shore line.

*Shore water > Factor*
   Factor for mixing water color just near the shoreline.


Refraction
----------

Under the "Render" tab in the "Reflections and Refractions" panel set
the "Refractions" option to "ON" or "AUTO".

*Subdivisions*
   Generated mesh subdivisions.

*Detailed Distance*
   Maximum distance from camera to the last cascades edge.


Baking Shoreline Data to Texture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the tools panel (hotkey "T") under the "Blend4Web" tab open the
"Bake Shore Distance Map" panel. Set the parameters: maximum distance
to shore ("Maximum Distance") and the resulting texture size ("Texture
Size"). Select a landscape object (or multiple objects) first, and
then - a water object. Click the "Bake" button.

Depending on the texture size and the number of vertices in the
processed meshes the execution time of the script may vary from a
fraction of a second up to several minutes. Make sure that the texture
named "ShoreDistance" is created for the water mesh.

Upon script execution some system properties are saved in the water
material. Therefore the scene must be saved after the script has
finished working.


Atmosphere
==========


Scattering
----------

Enable "World > Render Sky", then activate "Procedural Sky" panel
under the "World" tab. Please note, that if a static skydome texture
is being used at the same time, it will be replaced.

Note: Also, a procedural sky texture can be used to imitate
  scattered environment lighting similar to the static skydome
  texture. To do this, enable the "Procedural Sky > Use as Environment
  Lighting" and "Environment Lighting > Sky Texture" options. If the
  world texture for environment lighting already exists, it will be
  replaced.
