Postprocessing Effects
**********************


Motion Blur
===========

The motion blur effect can be used to improve the realism of an
interactive scene. It is displayed as picture blurring when the camera
or objects move.

[image]


Activation
----------

Activate the "Motion Blur" panel on the "Render" tab.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Factor*
   Effect appearance ratio. The higher this value is the stronger is
   the motion blur.

*Decay threshold*
   Blur fade-out ratio. The higher this value is the more distinct is
   the effect. The default value is 0.01.


Depth of Field
==============

The depth of field effect (DOF) can be used to accentuate a part of a
scene. It is displayed as picture blurring nearer and further from the
camera focus.

[image]


Activation
----------

1. Select an active camera and go to its settings panel "Camera"
   ("Object Data").

2. Then two options are available:

      * Select an object to use as the camera's focus in the "Focus"
        option of the "Depth of Field" panel. In this case moving away
        or approaching this object will cause a corresponding
        correction of the camera focus.

      * Set a non-zero value for the "Distance" on the same panel
        (in Blender units = meters). In this case the camera focus
        will be located at this distance from the camera and will move
        together with it.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Front*
   The distance from the focus to the nearest plane (relative to the
   camera) behind which full blurring occurs (in meters). The default
   value is 1.0.

*Rear*
   The distance from the focus to the furthest plane (relative to the
   camera) behind which full blurring occurs (in meters). The default
   value is 1.0.

*Power*
   Blurring ratio. The default value is 3.0.


Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion
==============================

The screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) effect can be used to fake
complex light reflections from objects. The basis of this effect is
that the space between close objects is less accessible for diffused
light and hence is darker.

[image]


Activation
----------

Activate the "Ambient Occlusion SSAO" panel under the "Render" tab and
set the "Render Shadows" parameter to "AUTO" or "ON"  on the "Rander >
Shadows" panel.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Radius Increase*
   The spherical sampling radius multiply factor when transfering from
   the internal sampling ring to the external one. The default value
   is 3.0.

*Use Hemisphere*
   Use a hemispherical sampling for shading instead of a spherical.
   Besides it uses different shading law.

*Use Blur Depth Test*
   Use edge-preserving blur to SSAO if flag will be turned on.
   Otherwise it uses blur which averages a 4x4 rectangle around each
   pixel.

*Blur Depth Test Discard Value*
   Influence of depth difference between samples on blur weight. It
   uses with "Use Blur Depth Test" activated flag. The default value
   is 1.0.

*Influence*
   SSAO appearance factor. The default value is 0.7.

*Distance Factor*
   Factor of SSAO decay with distance. The default value is 0.0 (i.e.
   no decay).

*Samples*
   Number of samples (the more samples there are the better is the
   quality but the poorer is the performance). The default value is
   16.


God Rays
========

The god rays effect (aka crepuscular rays) simulates well-known
natural phenomenon - the shining of illuminated air parts.

[image]


Activation
----------

Activate the "God Rays" panel under the "Render" tab.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Intensity*
   The effect appearance factor. The default value is 0.7.

*Maximum Ray Length*
   Rays length factor. Defines the step between samples of radial
   blurring. The default value is 1.0.

*Steps Per Pass*
   Number of steps per single sample. The default value is 10.0.


Bloom
=====

Bloom appears when a picture has elements with a very different
brightness. A glowing halo is created around the bright details.

[image]


Activation
----------

Activate the "Bloom" panel under the "Render" tab.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Key*
   Bloom intensity.

*Blur*
   Bloom blurriness factor.

*Edge Luminance*
   The boundary value of an element's relative brightness above which
   the bloom effect appears.


Outlining
=========

As a result of the outline glow effect, a luminous colored halo will
be displayed around the object.

[image]


Activation
----------

The outlining is activated programmatically via API. Different
animation models can be applied such as constant glow, fading out
glow, pulsatory glow and any other. In order to enable the outlining
effect on a certain object, make sure that the "Render > Object
Outlining" panel's "Enable" property is set to "ON" or "AUTO".


Additional settings
-------------------

On the "Object > Selection and Outlining" panel:

*Enable Outlining*
   Permit using the outline glow effect on this object.

*Duration*
   Duration of glow animation, seconds. The default value is 1.

*Period*
   Repeat period of glow animation, seconds. The default value is 1.

*Relapses*
   The number of iterations of glow animation. If zero, animation is
   repeated forever. The default value is 0.

*Outline on Select*
   Activate glow animation upon selecting the object. In this case the
   "Selectable" option must be enabled. In case of a user-defined glow
   animation model, this option must be disabled in order to avoid
   conflict.

On the "Render > Object Outlining" panel:

*Factor*
   When this parameter decreases so does the thickness and the
   brightness of the halo around the object. The default value is 1.

The "Render > Object Outlining" settings are taken as default when the
glow effect is initiated via API.


Stereo rendering
================

The stereoscopic rendering mode is intended for viewing the content
using special glasses. It is activated by an application via API.

Blend4Web supports two techniques of the stereo image rendering -
anagliph image and the HMD (head-mounted display).

Anaglyph:

HMD:

[image]

HMD is an experimental feature, for now it works only with the "Eye"
type cameras.


Activation
----------

To use HMD stereo rendering, you need to install Oculus's runtime
utility. Windows and MacOS versions can be found on the Oculus web
site in binary format, while Linux version should be compiled from the
source code.

For now, the HMD is supported by the Chromium experimental builds and
in the Firefox nightly builds.

Chromium settings.

Firefox settings.

To turn the stereo rendering on, you need to choose certain option in
the settings, in the third column from the right, as shown on the
picture.

[image]

For stereo rendering to work correctly, switching to the full screen
mode is recommended.


Additional settings
-------------------

None.


Color Correction
================

[image]


Activation
----------

Activate the "Color Correction" panel under the "Render" tab.


Additional settings
-------------------

*Brightness*
   The default value is 0.0.

*Contrast*
   The default value is 0.0.

*Exposure*
   The default value is 1.0.

*Saturation*
   The default value is 1.0.


Glow
====

Effect of halo which is observed around emissive objects due to light
scattering in the atmosphere and inside the human eye.

[image]


Activation
----------

Add a B4W_GLOW_OUTPUT node to a node material. The "Enable Glow
Materials" option on the "Render > Glow Materials" panel should be set
to "ON" or "AUTO".


Additional settings
-------------------

*Small Mask: Intensity*
   Intensity of glow obtained through the smaller mask. The default
   value is 2.0.

*Small Mask: Width*
   Width of glow obtained through the smaller mask. The default value
   is 2.0.

*Large Mask: Intensity*
   Intensity of glow obtained through the larger mask. The default
   value is 2.0.

*Large Mask: Width*
   Width of glow obtained through the larger mask. The default value
   is 6.0.

*Render Glow Over Transparent Objects*
   Render the glow effect over transparent objects.


Anti-Aliasing
=============

Anti-aliasing is used to reduce undesirable rendering artefacts (poor
pixelization).

[image]


Activation
----------

Select quality profile using "AA Quality" menu located on the "Render
> Anti-Aliasing" panel.

   * *None* - disable anti-aliasing,

   * *Low*, *Medium*, *High* - enable anti-aliasing with the given
     quality profile.

*Medium* profile is used by default.


Additional settings
-------------------

The anti-aliasing method is assigned simultaneously with the selection
of the engine performance profile:

   * *low quality* - no anti-aliasing,

   * *high quality* and *ultra quality* - use the FXAA 3.11
     algorithm (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing by Nvidia).
