Shading Types
=============

Lighting (shading) depends on the direction of normal vectors. The
standard Blender's shading types are supported: "Shading: Flat" (face
normals are used), "Shading: Smooth" (interpolated vertex normals are
used) and their combinations.

If the required effect is impossible to achieve with the standard
tools, you can use the normals editor.

The result of applying different shading types and using the normals
editor:

1. Flat Shading

2. Smooth Shading

3. Smooth Shading + bevel

4. Smooth Shading + bevel + editing normals


Lighting with Light Sources
===========================

A scene can have multiple (but not less than one) light sources of
different types.


Light source types
------------------

The following light source types are supported:

*Point*
   Light propagates from one point uniformly to all directions with
   gradual attenuation.

*Sun*
   Light propagates from an infinite plane in one direction without
   attenuation.

*Spot*
   Light propagates from one point within the angular limit, with
   gradual attenuation.

*Hemi*
   Hemispherical. Light propagates from an infinite hemisphere without
   attenuation.


Light source setup
------------------

Performed in the "Object Data" tab when a lamp object is selected.

*Color*
   Light color. The default value is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) (i.e. white).

*Energy*
   Radiation intensity. The default value is 1.0.

*Falloff*
   Attenuation type. The value is exported but the engine always uses
   "Inverse Square". It is applicable to the "Point" and "Spot" light
   source types. The default value is "Inverse Square".

*Distance*
   Attenuation parameter. It is applicable to the "Point" and "Spot"
   light source types. The default value is 25.0.

*Specular*
   Create specular highlights. Enabled by default.

*Diffuse*
   Do diffuse shading. Enabled by default.

*Spot Shape > Size*
   Cone angle in degrees. It is applicable to the "Spot" light source
   type. The default value is 45º.

*Spot Shape > Blend*
   Parameter for blurring light spot edges. It is applicable to the
   "Spot" light source type. The default value is 0.15.

*Dynamic Intensity*
   Use this light source for calculating the time of day. Applicable
   only to the "Sun" light source type. Disabled by default.

*Shadow > Shadow*
   Use this light source for shadow calculation. Should be used when
   multiple light sources are present. Disabled by default.


Environment Lighting (Ambient)
==============================

The engine supports 3 methods of the environment lighting simulation.

1. Flat white lighting.

2. Hemispherical lighting model in which horizon and zenith colors
   should be specified. As a result objects are filled with a gradient
   between these two colors depending on the direction of normals.

3. Lighting using an environment map - so called image-based
   lighting.


Activation
----------

Enable the "Environment Lighting" checkbox on the "World" tab.

[图片]


Setup
-----

*World > Environment Lighting > Energy*
   Environment lighting intensity. The default value is 1.0.

*World > Environment Lighting > Environment Color*
   Selection of the environment lighting simulation method: "White" -
   flat white lighting, "Sky Color" - hemispherical model, "Sky
   Texture" - lighting using an environment map. The default value is
   "White".

*World > Horizon Color* and *World > Zenith Color*
   If the hemispherical model ("Sky Color") is selected the horizon
   and zenith colors can be specified by means of the "World > Horizon
   Color" and "World > Zenith Color" color pickers. It is recommended
   to activate the "World > Blend Sky" option for better color
   selection.


Environment map method
----------------------

To use an environment map for environment lighting:

1. Enable the "Environment Lighting" checkbox on the "World" tab.

2. Select "Environment Lighting > Sky Texture".

3. Go from the "World" tab to the "Texture" tab.

4. Create an environment map, load the corresponding image to it.

5. For the environment map select "ENVIRONMENT_LIGHTING" or "BOTH"
   as the "Sky Texture Usage" value on the "Export Options" panel (the
   "BOTH" option also enables using this texture as a skydome
   texture).

Shadows
=======

Shadows are exceptionally important for rendering the final picture.
They provide the viewer not only with information about the objects'
outline but also about their height and relative position, light
source position and so on.

Blend4Web implements the following shadow rendering techniques:
cascaded shadow maps (CSM) and softened shadows (PCF).

Up to 4 (or 3 if SSAO is enabled) light sources can generate shadows
simultaneously. If *Shadow* parameter is enabled for more than 4 light
sources, shadows will still be generated only from 4 of them.

[图片]


Activation
----------

1. Enable the "Shadows: Cast" checkbox under the "Object" tab for
   the objects which **cast** shadows.

2. Enable the "Shadows: Receive" checkbox under the "Object" tab
   for the objects which **receive** shadows.

3. Make sure that the "Shadows" option in the "Render" tab has the
   value "AUTO" or "ON".

注解: Objects, which have transparent materials with a gradient, do
  not cast shadows.[图片]




Setup
-----

*Direction*
   If there are multiple light sources, it is recommended to specify
   the exact light source which is used for shadow calculations, by
   enabling the "Shadow > Shadow" checkbox under the "Object Data" tab
   for the selected lamp object.

*Color*
   The shadow color is determined by the environment lighting
   settings.

The following additional settings are located on the "Shadows" panel
of the "Render" tab:

[图片]

*Resolution*
   Shadow map resolution. The default value is 2048x2048px.

*Self-Shadow Polygon Offset*
   Coefficient for shifting polygons relative to light source
   orientation. The default value is 1.

*Self-Shadow Normal Offset*
   Coefficient for shifting polygons along their normals. The default
   value is 0.010.

The last two parameters can be used to reduce self-shadowing
artifacts. These artifacts appear for the objects that cast and
receive shadows at the same time. The "Self-Shadow Polygon Offset"
parameter is more effective for fighting against artifacts in inner
areas of polygons while "Self-Shadow Normal Offset" is better for the
boundary areas. Both these parameters lead to shadow distortions so we
recommend to set them as low as possible.

注解: Shadows from "Point" light sources are generated the same way
  as from "Spot" light sources and are projected only in one direction
  specified by the source's "Rotation" parameter.



*Enable CSM*
   Activates the using of cascaded shadows model; reveals additional
   options. Disabled by default. Won't work if the "Shadow" setting is
   enabled for more than one light source. "Point" and "Spot" type
   light sources support only one shadow cascade.

This option allows to choose between the following shadow generation
models:

* Generic model which uses a single optimized shadow map for the
  whole scene ("Enable CSM" is turned off).

* Shadow cascades ("Enable CSM" is turned on).

*Blur Radius*
   Blur ratio for setting up softened shadows. The default value is 3.
   Zero value produces hard shadows.

Softened shadows can improve visual quality and realism. They hide the
jugged edges inevitable when using image-based techniques, that is
especially noticeable for low-resolution shadow maps. The using of
softened shadows often allows to decrease resolution without
substantial quality loss.


Generic shadows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option suits well smaller scenes with a limited number of
objects. Thanks to optimizations applied for such scenes, one can
achieve better shadow quality as compared with cascaded shadows. Also,
this option is simpler and faster for setting up, while using a single
shadow map greatly improves the performance.


Shadow cascades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

注解: These settings are supported only for "Sun" light sources.
  Cascades are turned off for other types of light sources.

In order to provide acceptable shadow quality and to cover
considerable space at the same time it is required to use multiple
stages for shadow generation (cascades). Thus, the best quality
cascades are situated near the observer while the worst quality
cascades are in the distance. This option suits well middle-to-large
scenes, e.g. game levels.

When enabled the following extended settings are revealed:

[图片]



*CSM Number*
   Number of shadow cascades. From 1 to 4 cascades are supported. The
   default value is 1.

*CSM First Cascade Border*
   First cascade size. The default value is 10.0.

*CSM Last Cascade Border*
   Last cascade size. The default value is 100.0.

The sizes of the intermediate cascades are interpolated between the
two above-mentioned parameters.

注解: When setting up the shadows keep in mind that the bigger the
  cascade size is, the worse and less detailed are the shadows inside
  it. On the other hand, reducing the "CSM First Cascade Border"
  parameter makes the subsequent less detailed cascades closer to the
  camera and thus more noticeable. Reducing the "CSM Last Cascade
  Border" parameter forces shadows to disappear at more close distance
  from the camera. However, when softened shadows are used the overall
  quality will improve thanks to blurring at the edges.

[图片]



*CSM First Cascade Blur Radius*
   Blur ratio for the first cascade. The default value is 3. Zero
   value produces hard shadows.

*CSM Last Cascade Blur Radius*
   Blur ratio for the last cascade. The default value is 1.5. Zero
   value produces hard shadows.

The blur radii of the intermediate cascades are interpolated between
the two above-mentioned parameters.

注解: We recommend to start setting up the softened shadows with the
  first cascade (using "CSM First Cascade Blur Radius") and then
  proceed to other cascades (using "CSM Last Cascade Blur Radius").
  Often the last cascade may need less blurring than the first one.
  This may be needed to prevent the shadows on the last cascade being
  too faded due to low resolution. This also reduces undesirable self-
  shadowing artifacts.

*Fade-out Last Cascade*
   Smooth dying-out of the last cascade. Enabled by default.

*Blend Between Cascades*
   Smoothing the boundaries between the cascades. Enabled by default.

Background
==========

You can change the background in the following ways:

1. Enable "World > Render Sky", then set the "Horizon Color" and
   the "Zenith Color" under Blender's "World" tab.

2. Place the whole scene inside a model (e.g. a cube or a sphere)
   with its normals directed inside, with a material and an optional
   texture.

3. Place a surface with a material and an optional texture in front
   of the camera. Parent it to the camera. If required, tweak the
   distance to this surface, starting and ending clipping planes for
   the camera.

4. Use a skydome.

5. Set up the procedurally generated atmosphere.

6. Set the engine's "background_color" parameter with the
   "config.set()" method. Please note, that "World > Render Sky" under
   Blender's "World" tab must be disabled. This value is used as
   argument for the WebGL "clearColor()" method. For correct results,
   it's recommended to turn the WebGL context transparency off (the
   "alpha" parameter). Such the configuration is used by default in
   the engine's standard web player.

         var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
         var m_main = b4w.require("main");

         // gray
         m_cfg.set("background_color", new Float32Array([0.224, 0.224, 0.224, 1.0]));
         m_cfg.set("alpha", false);

         m_main.init(...);

7. You can use any HTML content behind the *canvas* element, to
   which the rendering is performed, as a background. To do this,
   activate the WebGL context transparency (the "alpha" parameter).
   Please note, that "World  > Render Sky" under Blender's "World" tab
   must be disabled. For correct results, it's recommended to set
   absolutely transparent black background color. Such the
   configuration is used by default in the scene viewer of Blend4Web
   SDK.

         var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
         var m_main = b4w.require("main");

         m_cfg.set("background_color", new Float32Array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]));
         m_cfg.set("alpha", true);

         m_main.init(...);
