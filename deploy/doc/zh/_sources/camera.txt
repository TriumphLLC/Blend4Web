Move Styles and General Settings
================================

The camera settings are specified in the "Properties" panel under the
"Camera (Object Data)" tab.

[图片]



*Camera Move Style > Move Style*
   Camera control mode:

   * *Target*

        By default the camera is rotating around a fixed point
        (target). The pivot's position can be changed (see camera
        panning).

   * *Eye*

        The "Eye" mode allows rotation and translation as in first
        person view.

   * *Hover*

        In "Hover" mode, camera moves parallel to the horizontal
        plane. By using additional limits, a smooth movement path
        toward the pivot point for the camera can be created.

   * *Static*

        In the "Static" mode the camera can be moved via animation or
        through API calls.

*Look At Cursor > Target Location*
   Available for the "Target" mode. This is the position of the camera
   pivot point. The "Look At Cursor" button copies the current 3D
   cursor position into this value.

*Depth of Field*
   Described in the 景深 section.

Velocity settings are available for camera movement.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Velocities > Translation Velocity*
   Available for the "Target", "Eye" and "Hover" type cameras. Sets
   the velocity of the camera translation. Possible value interval:
   \left[0,\ \infty \right). Default value is 1.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Velocities > Rotation Velocity*
   Available for the "Target", "Eye" and "Hover" type cameras. Sets
   the camera rotation speed. Possible value interval: \left[0,\
   \infty \right). Default value is 1.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Velocities > Zoom Velocity*
   Available for the "Target" and "Hover" type cameras. Set the
   velocity of the camera approaching the pivot point. Possible value
   interval: \left[0,\ 0.99\right]. Default value is 0.1.


Limiting the Camera Movement
============================

There are several settings for the camera which limit/change its
movement one way or another. They are grouped as "Camera Limits".

[图片]

Camera limits can be viewed right in the Blender viewport, if the
"Display Limits in Viewport" parameter is enabled.




**Target Type Camera**
----------------------

[图片]

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Distance Limits*
   Set minimum and maximum distances from the camera to the pivot
   point. Allowable values: *Min* \le *Max*. Default values: *Min =
   1*, *Max = 10*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Horizontal Rotation Limits*
   Limit the horizontal (around the Z world axis in Blender) camera
   rotation around the corresponding point. Rotation is performed
   along the arc of a circle between "Left Angle" and "Right Angle"
   values. The rotation arc corresponds to movement from "Left Angle"
   to "Right Angle" anticlockwise. Default values: *Left Angle =
   -45°*, *Right Angle = 45°*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Vertical Rotation Limits*
   Limit the horizontal (around the Z world axis in Blender) camera
   rotation around the corresponding point. Rotation is performed
   along the arc of a circle between "Left Angle" and "Right Angle"
   values. The rotation arc corresponds to movement from "Left Angle"
   to "Right Angle" anticlockwise. Default values: *Left Angle =
   -45°*, *Right Angle = 45°*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Pivot Translation Limits*
   Limit the translation of the camera's pivot point. Default values:
   *MinZ = 0*, *MaxZ = 10*. Not rendered in the viewport.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Use Panning Mode*
   Allow camera panning.




**Eye Type Camera**
-------------------

[图片]

*Blend4Web > Horizontal Rotation Limits*
   Limit the horizontal (around the Z world axis in Blender) camera
   rotation around the corresponding point. Rotation is performed
   along the arc of a circle between "Left Angle" and "Right Angle"
   values. The rotation arc corresponds to movement from "Left Angle"
   to "Right Angle" anticlockwise. Default values: *Left Angle =
   -45°*, *Right Angle = 45°*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Vertical Rotation Limits*
   Limit the vertical (around the local X axis in Blender) camera
   rotation around the corresponding point. Rotation is performed
   along the arc of a circle between "Down Angle" and "Up Angle"
   values. The rotation arc corresponds to movement from "Down Angle"
   to "Up Angle" anticlockwise. Default values: *Down Angle = -45°*,
   *Up Angle = 45°*. Disabled by default.




**Hover Type Camera**
---------------------

[图片]

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Horizontal Translation Limits*
   Limit movement of the pivot point along the Blender's world X axis.
   Allowable values: *Min* \le *Max*. Default values: *MinX = -10*,
   *MaxX = 10*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Vertical Translation Limits*
   Limit movement of the pivot point along the Blender's world X axis.
   Allowable values: *Min* \le *Max*. Default values: *MinY = -10*,
   *MaxY = 10*. Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Use Zooming*
   Allows user to zoom the camera in and out from the pivot point. If
   this parameter is disabled, the camera will always remain at a
   fixed distance from the pivot point. Disable by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Distance Limits*
   Set minimum and maximum distances from the camera to the point of
   intersection between the camera's view direction and the horizontal
   reference plane (Blender's world XOY plane by default). Allowable
   values: *Min* \le *Max*. Default values: *Min = 1*, *Max = 10*.
   Disabled by default.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Vertical Rotation Limits*
   Limits the camera's angle of elevation (an angle between the
   camera's sight line and a horizontal plane. Possible value
   interval: *0°* \le *Down* \le *Up* \le *90°*. Default values: *Down
   = 0°, Up = 90°*.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Zero Level*
   A distance between reference plane and the coordinates origin. Set
   to zero by default.

If the "Blend4Web > Use Zooming" setting is turned on, the limits for
distance and inclination angle will be applied simultaneously, to
define the camera movement path in the vertical plane.

Setting incorrect distance or elevation angle limits will disable this
parameter.

*Camera Move Style > Camera Limits > Use Horizontal Rotation*
   Allow camera rotation in Blender's XOY plane around to the pivot
   point. Enabled by default.



**Static Camera**

[图片]

This type of camera does not have limits, as it can't be directly
controlled by the user.



**Peculiarities of Limiting Settings**

* For EYE/TARGET cameras, interchanging *Left/Right* or *Down/Up*
  values results in movement along the opposite arc of a circle.

* When limiting the camera's horizontal and vertical rotation, it is
  possible to choose between the following coordinate spaces:

*Camera Space*
   All angles are measured relative to the initial camera position and
   orientation.

*World Space*
   Horizontal angles are measured relative to the Y axis in world
   space; vertical angles are measured relative to the Blender's XOY
   plane in world space.

Default value: "Camera Space".

Horizontal limits by the example of the TARGET camera:

Vertical limits by the example of the TARGET camera:


Viewport Alignment
==================

If an object is parented to a camera, the set of parameters known as
*Viewport Alignment* are available under the "Relations" tab on the
"Object" panel.

[图片]

Using these settings, the object can be aligned to the active camera,
so that the object will remain in the same place of the screen
regardless of the position and rotation of the camera. This is
especially useful for creating UI elements.

   [图片]

This picture shows an example of how the Viewport Alignment option can
be used.

*Viewport Alignment*
   This parameter enables and disables all the following parameters.
   It is disabled by default.

*Alignment*
   This parameter specifies what side of the screen the object will be
   aligned with. It can have one of the following values.

   * "Top-Left" - aligns the object in the top left corner of the
     viewport

   * "Top" - aligns the object in the top of the viewport

   * "Top-Right" - aligns the object in the top right corner of the
     viewport

   * "Left" - aligns the object in the left side of the viewport

   * "Center" - aligns the object in the center of the viewport

   * "Right" - aligns the object in the right side of the viewport

   * "Bottom-Left" - aligns the object in the bottom left corner of
     the viewport

   * "Bottom" - aligns the object in the bottom of the viewport

   * "Bottom-Right" - aligns the object in the bottom right corner
     of the viewport.

   Default value is "Center".

*Distance*
   This specifies the distance between the aligned object and the
   camera. It is set to 10 by default.

*Fit to Camera*
   By pressing this button, you can make the aligned object look the
   same way in the Blender viewport as it will look in the engine. It
   can be used to preview alignment results.


Camera Controls API
===================

Detailed API module documentation: link.

A camera's position and its spatial orientation are defined by the
control mode. In the "EYE", "TARGET" and "HOVER" modes, control mode
has several limitations: for example, the camera's vertical axis is
always aligned along the world's Y-axis and the camera is constantly
focused on the pivot point. The "STATIC" mode camera has no such
limitations, which makes it more suitable for cases when you need more
complete control, such as procedural animation.

Main functions for camera control are located in the camera module.
Some of them (intended for a specific control mode) have names which
start with an appropriate prefix: "static_", "eye_", "target_" and
"hover_". Other functions can be used in any mode.


Control Mode Setup
------------------

To change the control mode and to completely define a camera's
behavior, the following methods can be used: static_setup(),
eye_setup(), target_setup() and hover_setup(). These methods receive
an object that contains a set of optional parameters, which can be
used to set the camera's position, rotation, available limits and so
on.

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();
   var POS = new Float32Array([1,1,1]);
   var LOOK_AT = new Float32Array([0,0,0]);
   var EYE_HORIZ_LIMITS = { left: Math.PI/4, right: -Math.PI/4 };
   var EYE_VERT_LIMITS = { down: -Math.PI/4, up: Math.PI/4 };
   var TARGET_DIST_LIMITS = { min: 1, max: 10 };
   var HOVER_DIST_LIMITS = { min: 1, max: 10 };
   var HOVER_ANGLE_LIMITS = { down: 0, up: -Math.PI/4 };
   var HOVER_HORIZ_TRANS_LIMITS = { min: -5, max: 3 };
   var HOVER_VERT_TRANS_LIMITS = { min: -1, max: 1 };

   ...

   // setup STATIC camera by defining the new position and the new look-at point
   m_cam.static_setup(camera, { pos: POS, look_at: LOOK_AT });

   // setup STATIC camera by defining the new look-at point and keeping the existing position
   m_cam.static_setup(camera, { look_at: LOOK_AT });

   // setup STATIC camera by defining the new position and keeping the existing orientation
   m_cam.static_setup(camera, { pos: POS });

   // setup EYE camera with horizontal rotation limits
   m_cam.eye_setup(camera, { pos: POS, look_at: LOOK_AT,
           horiz_rot_lim: EYE_HORIZ_LIMITS });

   // setup EYE camera with vertical rotation limits
   m_cam.eye_setup(camera, { pos: POS, look_at: LOOK_AT,
           vert_rot_lim: EYE_VERT_LIMITS });

   // setup TARGET camera with distance limits and panning mode
   m_cam.target_setup(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: LOOK_AT,
           dist_lim: TARGET_DIST_LIMITS, use_panning: true });

   // setup HOVER camera on a fixed distance (without zooming) reltively to its pivot
   m_cam.hover_setup(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: LOOK_AT });

   // setup HOVER camera with zooming (distance + angle limits)
   m_cam.hover_setup(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: LOOK_AT,
           dist_lim: HOVER_DIST_LIMITS, hover_angle_lim: HOVER_ANGLE_LIMITS });

   // setup HOVER camera with translation limits
   m_cam.hover_setup(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: LOOK_AT,
           horiz_trans_lim: HOVER_HORIZ_TRANS_LIMITS,
           vert_trans_lim: HOVER_VERT_TRANS_LIMITS });

   // setup HOVER camera with horizontal rotation enabled
   m_cam.hover_setup(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: LOOK_AT, enable_horiz_rot: true });

The main characteristic of the "HOVER" type camera is the fact that
the distance and elevation angle limits define a certain path of
movement toward the pivot point. The camera will always be located on
this path, so its final position can be different from the one
returned by the hover_setup() method (basically, it is projected onto
the path). If you need to set the camera's position on some path, you
can use the hover_setup_rel() method to set the relative limits.

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();
   var POS = new Float32Array([1,1,1]);
   var PIVOT = new Float32Array([0,0,0]);

   ...

   // setup HOVER camera with maintaining the given camera position and
   // ability to zoom-in and zoom-out equally
   m_cam.hover_setup_rel(camera, { pos: POS, pivot: PIVOT, dist_interval: 2,
           angle_interval: Math.PI/4 });

The current camera mode can be checked with the is_static_camera(),
is_eye_camera(), is_target_camera(), is_hover_camera() or
get_move_style() methods:

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();

   ...

   if (m_cam.is_static_camera(camera))
       console.log("STATIC camera!");

   if (m_cam.get_move_style(camera) == m_cam.MS_EYE_CONTROLS)
       console.log("EYE camera!");

注解: If you need to change only some aspects of the camera's
  behavior, you can use the methods described below.


Translation and Rotation
------------------------

To rotate a "STATIC" type camera, you need to use the
static_get_rotation() and static_set_rotation() methods. In these
methods, rotation is defined by a quaternion.

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();

   ...

   // rotation through a quaternion
   var _quat_tmp = new Float32Array(4);
   var old_quat = m_cam.static_get_rotation(camera, _quat_tmp);
   var new_quat = m_quat.rotateX(old_quat, Math.PI/2, old_quat)
   m_cam.static_set_rotation(camera, new_quat);

For the "EYE", "TARGET" and "HOVER" type cameras, rotation is
performed in spherical coordinates by using the eye_rotate(),
target_rotate(), hover_rotate() and rotate_camera() methods:

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();

   ...

   // rotate by given delta angles
   m_cam.eye_rotate(camera, Math.PI/6, Math.PI/2);

   // set absolute rotation in world space
   m_cam.eye_rotate(camera, Math.PI/6, Math.PI/2, true, true);

Current spherical coordinates of the camera can be obtained by using
the get_camera_angles() method:

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();
   var _vec2_tmp = new Float32Array(2);

   ...

   // get camera orientation in spherical coordinates
   var angles = m_cam.get_camera_angles(camera, _vec2_tmp);
   phi = angles[0];
   theta = angles[1];

Access to the position of the camera can be obtained by using the
get_translation() and set_translation() methods. For the "TARGET" and
"HOVER" modes this means simultaneous translation of an entire model,
including camera position and pivot point.

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();
   var _vec3_tmp = new Float32Array(3);

   ...

   // get camera position
   var pos = m_cam.get_translation(camera, _vec3_tmp);

   // set new position
   var new_pos = m_vec3.set(1, 0, 2, pos);
   m_cam.set_translation(camera, new_pos);

Additional camera translation methods:

* target_set_trans_pivot(), target_set_pivot_translation(),
  hover_set_pivot_translation() - sets the position and the pivot
  point of the camera at the same time;

* target_get_distance(), target_set_distance() - translation based
  on the distance to the pivot point;

* static_set_look_at(), eye_set_look_at() - sets the camera's
  position and point of sight simultaneously;

注解: Because a camera is a scene object, transform module methods
  can also be used. But, as every control mode influences camera
  movement differently, results may differ from those expected.


Limit Setup
-----------

Camera limits are available for the "EYE", "TARGET" and "HOVER" type
cameras. To set a specific limit, you need to use a specific method:

+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| EYE                                            | TARGET                                            | HOVER                                             |
+================================================+===================================================+===================================================+
| eye_get_horizontal_limits()                    | target_get_distance_limits()                      | hover_get_distance_limits()                       |
| eye_set_horizontal_limits()                    | target_set_distance_limits()                      | hover_set_distance_limits()                       |
| eye_get_vertical_limits()                      | target_get_horizontal_limits()                    | hover_get_vertical_limits()                       |
| eye_set_vertical_limits()                      | target_set_horizontal_limits()                    | hover_set_vertical_limits()                       |
|                                                | target_get_vertical_limits()                      | hover_get_horiz_trans_limits()                    |
|                                                | target_set_vertical_limits()                      | hover_set_horiz_trans_limits()                    |
|                                                | target_get_pivot_limits target_set_pivot_limits   | hover_get_vert_trans_limits()                     |
|                                                |                                                   | hover_set_vert_trans_limits()                     |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

   var camera = m_scenes.get_active_camera();
   var _limits_tmp = {};
   var EYE_HORIZ_LIMITS = { left: Math.PI/4, right: -Math.PI/4 };

   ...

   // get limits
   m_cam.eye_get_horizontal_limits(camera, _limits_tmp);

   // set limits
   m_cam.eye_set_horizontal_limits(camera, EYE_HORIZ_LIMITS);

Limit presence can be checked by using the has_distance_limits(),
has_horizontal_rot_limits(), has_vertical_rot_limits(),
has_horizontal_trans_limits() and has_vertical_trans_limits() methods.

注解: In "HOVER" mode, the camera always has distance and elevation
  angle limits. In case these limits were not set, they are
  automatically calculated to lock the camera in the current position
  relative to the pivot point.

注解: When setting translation limits for the "HOVER" camera, the
  values for the limits will correspond to the engine's coordinate
  axis as follows:

  * "Horizontal Translation Limits" - X axis

  * "Vertical Translation Limits" - Z axis

注解: Enabled camera limits can influence its position and spatial
  orientation set by the API functions.


Angular Coordinates Count
-------------------------

   When working with the camera's APIs (rotation, setting limits), all
   angles are defined in the engine's coordinate system as follows:

   For the "TARGET/HOVER" camera:

For the "EYE" camera:
