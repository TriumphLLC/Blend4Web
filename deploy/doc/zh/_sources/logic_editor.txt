Basics
======

Visual programming is performed by creating logic node tree in the
node editor area in Blender. These nodes can extend the scene
functionality significantly without any coding.

[图片]

To activate logic on the given scene set the "Logic Editor" property
in the "Scene" tab and append/select active node tree.

[图片]

To edit logic tree go to the "Node Editor" area and select the
"Blend4Web Logic" tree type:

[图片]

Then select the required node tree:

[图片]



Nodes are created by using standard Blender keyboard shortcut
"Shift+A".

The nodes themselves are logic blocks that are executed from the
"Entry Point" node which has no inputs and only one output. All other
nodes have both inputs and outputs, and can be inserted in any place
of a logic tree. The exception is "Page Redirect" node, which can be
inserted only to the end of the node tree. The nodes which have two
outputs allow branching, thus the next leave is selected based on
condition specified for such nodes.

For implementing complicated logic there are variables that can have
either numeric or string values. The variables can be used for storing
some scene state (e.g. this can be a counter of animation playbacks,
character’s health points etc).

Logic Editor usage example:

All available nodes are described below.


Control Flow
============


Entry Point
-----------

This is where the script starts. By using multiple entry points you
can create multi-threaded applications.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Next*
   Next node.


Internal Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Run From Script*
   If this parameter is enabled, the entry point can be triggered via
   API by using the run_entrypoint method.


Switch Select
-------------

Can be used to trace the selection of any object from the object list.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Previous*
   Previous node.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*<object name> Hit*
   This parameter will pass the control to the next node if the user
   selects (with a mouse or by touch) an object mentioned in the
   parameter’s name. The "Switch Select" node has one such parameter
   by default, but you can add new ones and remove existing ones (the
   node can even have no such parameters).

*Miss*
   This parameter will pass the control to the next node if the user
   hasn’t selected any of the objects specified in the "Switch Select"
   node.


Internal Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Object*
   One of the objects that the user can select. These parameters are
   automatically created and deleted when you create or delete a "Hit"
   parameter. The number of such parameters is always equal to the
   number of the "Hit" parameters.


Delay
-----

Make a delay before going to the next node.

parameters (operands) can also be variables that are activated using
the corresponding switches.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Previous*
   Previous node.


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*True*
   Condition is true.

   * *Not Equal* - first operand is not equal to the second.

   * *Less Than* - first operand is less than the second.

   * *Greater Than* - first operand is greater than the second.

   * *Less Than Or Equal* - first operand is less than or equal to
     the second.

   * *Greater Than Or Equal* - first operand is greater than or
     equal to the second.

*In Params*
   A list of the input parameters of the function. Each parameter can
   be either a variable or a link to a scene object. The number of the
   input parameters can be adjusted. By default, this list is empty.

   Input parameters are transferred to the callback function as an
   array that servers as the first argument of the function.

*Param <param_number>*
   Specifies an input parameter. This parameter can be a variable
   ("R1" by default) or a link to a scene object, depending on the
   value of the "Type" parameter (each one of these parameters always
   has a corresponding "Type" parameter).

*Type*
   The type of the corresponding input parameter. It can have one of
   the two values: "Variable" (in this case, one of the variables will
   be used as the parameter) and "Object" (a link to a scene object).

*Out Params*
   A list of the output parameters. Empty by default. The number of
   the output parameters can be adjusted.

   An array that consists of the output parameters serves as the
   second argument of the callback function.

*Param <param_number>*
   Specifies one of the variables that will be used as an output
   parameter. By default, "R1" varaible is used.


Animation
=========


Play Timeline and Stop Timeline
-------------------------------

Can be used to control NLA animations. The "Play Timeline" node plays
NLA fragment starting with a frame specified by the marker. Animation
plays until next marker is encountered, or to the end of the scene’s
timeline. After that, control passes on to the next node. The "Stop
Timeline" node stops the playback.

Deprecated
==========


Select (Deprecated)
-------------------

注解: Deprecated! Isn’t recommended to use. Instead, using a "Switch
  Select" node is recommended.

It is similar to the "Select & Play" node, except the transition
happens instead of animation. This function allows to implement a
complicated logic because in this case there is a possibility to
identify the user selection results.


Select & Play Timeline (Deprecated)
-----------------------------------

注解: Deprecated! Isn’t recommended to use. Instead, using a
  combination of "Switch Select" and "Play Timeline" nodes is
  recommended.

Wait until the user selects an object (on desktops - with a mouse
click, on mobile devices - with a touch). If the object, which is
specified in this node, is selected - then start the animation similar
to the "Play Timeline" node. If any other object is selected - then
immediately transfer control to the next node.

  combination of "Switch Select" and "Play Timeline" nodes is
  recommended.

Wait until the user selects an object (on desktops - with a mouse

Layout
======


Empty
-----

This is a simple pass-through node that does not perform any
operations on its own. It can be used to combine several logic threads
into one or simply to make the logic node setup easier to read and
understand.

[图片]


Input Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Previous*
   Previous node (or several nodes).


Output Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Next*
   Next node.


Internal Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None.


Reroute
-------

Logic Editor also has "Reroute" elements, the nodes that don’t do
anything aside from passing the control to the next node or to the
next "Reroute" element. Such elements can be used to create cyclic
structures or to make the node tree easier to read and understand.

Unlike the "Empty" node, "Reroute" element can only handle a single
logic thread.

[图片]

注解: Output parameter can’t be connected to the same node’s input
  parameter. If you need to do this (to make a cycle, for example),
  you should use "Reroute" elements.


Debugging
=========

For debugging purposes some nodes inside logic tree can be muted. To
do that select the required node and press the "M" key. Muted nodes
are not evaluated and simply pass control to the next ones. If the
muted node has two outputs the execution continues from the output
with negative result ("Miss", "False").
