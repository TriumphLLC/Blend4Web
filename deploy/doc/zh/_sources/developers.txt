Project Management
==================

You can manage your projects in two ways: by using *project.py*, which
is a simple-to-use and well documented CLI utility, or by using a
dedicated web application with GUI working on the local development
server. The server does not require any additional setup and starts
automatically with Blender. The index page of the Project Manager can
be opened by clicking on the "Project Manager" button in Blender.

Working with the Project Manager is described in a dedicated chapter.


Advanced Project Management
===========================

Advanced project management is used by experienced developers which
require more flexibility and need to automate process of project
development.

For advanced project management use the *project.py* script and
manually edit *.b4w_project* configuration files.


Dependencies
------------

The project management system works in all operating systems. However,
some operations can require installing additional dependencies. In
order to check whether all dependencies are met, use the following
command:

   ./project.py check_deps

For MS Windows users:

   python project.py check_deps


Projects List
-------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject list

Prints list of projects in the SDK.


Project Structure
-----------------

A typical app developed using the project manager looks as follows:

   blend4web/
       apps_dev/
           myproject/
               project.py
               .b4w_project
               myproject.js
               myproject.css
               myproject_dev.html
       blender/
           myproject/
               myproject.blend
       deploy/
           apps/
               myproject/
                   myproject.js
                   myproject.css
                   myproject.html
           assets/
               myproject/
                   myproject.json
                   myproject.bin

This app consists of 4 different directories.

1. apps_dev/myproject. Contains source files of project's apps.

2. blender/myproject. Contains source files of project's scenes.

3. deploy/assets/myproject. Contains exported files of project's
   scenes.

4. deploy/apps/myproject. Contains exported files of project's
   scenes.

Additionally, the deploy command can create yet another directory, but
it's usually placed outside of the SDK and its name and path depend on
directory structure on the target server.


".b4w_project" Configuration File
---------------------------------

If you did not use any arguments upon executing the *project.py*
script, then they will be taken from the configuration file.

   [info]
   author =
   name =
   title =
   icon =

   [paths]
   assets_dirs =
   blend_dirs =
   blender_exec =
   build_dir =
   deploy_dir =

   [compile]
   apps =
   css_ignore =
   engine_type = external
   js_ignore =
   optimization = simple
   use_physics =
   use_smaa_textures =
   version =

   [deploy]
   assets_path_dest =
   assets_path_prefix =
   remove_exist_ext_dir =


Advanced Project Management
---------------------------

   ./project.py init myproject

This command will create a project with the specified name in the
current directory. By default the project directory will only contain
a config file.

Available parameters:

* "-A | --copy-app-templates" (optional) create standard app
  templates in the project directory  (*<my_project_name>_dev.html*,
  *<my_project_name>.js*, *<my_project_name>.css*).

* "-B | --bundle" (optional) all project files will be placed in a
  single directory.

* "-C | --author" (optional) write an author's or a company's name
  in the config file.

* "-o | --optimization" (optional) write the script optimization
  level in the config file.

* "-P | --copy-project-script" (optional) create a copy of the
  *project.py* script in the project directory.

* "-S | --copy-scene-templates" (optional) create standard scene
  templates in the directories "deploy/assets/<my_project_name>" and
  "blender/<my_project_name>" (*<my_project_name>.json/.bin* and
  *<my_project_name>.blend* correspondingly).

* "-T | --title"" (optional) write a title in the config file. Upon
  building, it will be used inside the "<title>" HTML element.

* "-t | --engine-type" (optional) write an engine type in the config
  file.

Example:

   ./project.py init -AS -C Blend4Web -o simple -T MyProject -t external myproject

This command will create a directory named *myproject*, inside which
the following files will be placed: *myproject.js*, *myproject.css*,
*myproject_dev.html* and *.b4w_project*.

The .b4w_project file will look like:

   [info]
   author = Blend4Web
   name = myproject
   title = MyProject

   [paths]
   assets_dirs = deploy/assets/myproject;
   blend_dirs = blender/myproject;
   blender_exec = blender
   build_dir = deploy/apps/myproject
   deploy_dir =

   [compile]
   apps =
   css_ignore =
   engine_type = external
   js_ignore =
   optimization = simple
   use_physics =
   use_smaa_textures =
   version =

   [deploy]
   assets_path_prefix =
   remove_exist_ext_dir =


Developing multiple apps inside a project
-----------------------------------------

A project can contain multiple apps. This can be provided by listing
the corresponding HTML files in the config file separated with
semicolon:

   ...
   [compile]
   apps = myapp1;myapp2;
   ...


Building Projects
-----------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject compile

Builds a project in the "deploy/apps/myproject" directory.

注解: For script operation it's required to install java and  set
  the PATH system variable.

Available parameters:

* ""-a | --app"" (optional) specify an HTML file, relative to which
  the project app will be built.

* ""-c | --css-ignore"" (optional) add CSS styles to exceptions in
  order to not compile them.

* ""-j | --js-ignore"" (optional) add scripts to exceptions in order
  to not compile them.

* ""-o | --optimization"" (optional) specify the optimization level
  for JavaScript files: "whitespace", "simple" (by default) or
  "advanced".

* ""-t | --engine-type"" (optional) define a compilation type for an
  app. Four variants are available: *external* (by default), *copy*,
  *compile*, *update*.

* ""-v | --version"" add version to paths of scripts and styles.

Compiler Requirements

* In the root of the directory the single html file must be stored
  if "-a" option is disabled

* Scripts and styles can be stored in the app's root and in the
  subfolders


Automatic Re-export
-------------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject reexport

This command will re-export blend files in JSON and HTML formats.

Available parameters:

* ""-b | --blender-exec"" path to the blender executable.

* ""-s | --assets"" specify directory with scene assets.


Resource Conversion
-------------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject convert_resources

Converts external resources (textures, audio and video files) into
alternative formats to ensure cross-browser and cross-platform
performance.

Available parameters:

* ""-s | --assets"" specify directory with scene assets.

Converting of resources is described in detail in the corresponding
section.


Deploying Projects
------------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject deploy DIRECTORY

Save a project to an external directory together with all
dependencies.

Available parameters:

* ""-e | --assets-dest"" destination assets directory ("assets" by
  default).

* ""-E | --assets-prefix"" assets URL prefix ("assets" by default).

* ""-o | --override"" remove directory if it exists.

* ""-s | --assets"" override project's assets directory(s).

* ""-t | --engine-type"" override project's engine type config.


Remove Project
--------------

   python3 project.py -p myproject remove

Removes a project. Removed directories are retrieved from project
configuration file.


Upgrading Apps for New SDK Versions
-----------------------------------

While upgrading for new SDK versions often two problems arise:

1. Modules of the new and old versions of the engine do not match.

2. Old and new engine API do not match.

In order to update the list of modules imported in developer version
of application go to project source directory "apps_dev/my_project"
and execute module list generator script:

   python3 ../../scripts/mod_list.py

For MS Windows users:

   python ..\..\scripts\mod_list.py

注解: To run the scripts the Python 3.x needs to be installed in
  your system.

The console will print the list of modules - copy them and paste into
the main HTML file:

   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/b4w.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/anchors.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/animation.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/assets.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/batch.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/boundings.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="../../src/camera.js"></script>
       . . .
   </head>

To eliminate API incompatibilities you may require refactoring of your
app. All changes are described in release notes.


Path to Loaded Application Assets
---------------------------------

To load .json-files you should use "get_std_assets_path()" method from
the *config.js* module:

   m_data.load(m_config.get_std_assets_path() + "example/example.json", load_cb);

After building the finished app, the paths to assets will change.
Thus, using "get_std_assets_path()" will allow you to avoid problems
with incorrect paths.


Application Programming
=======================


"Hello World!" application
--------------------------

The simplest Blend4Web app may look like this:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <script src="b4w.min.js"></script>
   <script>
   function hello() {
       var m_version = b4w.require("version");
       document.body.innerHTML = "Hello, Blend4Web " + m_version.version() + "!";
   }
   </script>
   </head>

   <body onload="hello()"></body>

   </html>

This app prints a message and the engine's version in the browser
window. Let's look at this example in detail. The engine library is
embedded with the "<script src="...">" element. Then, the app waits
for the page to load and prints the current version in the browser
window. In this example, "version" is the only used module which has a
function with the same name - "version()". A more detailed info about
the usage of engine's modules and functions can be found in the API
documentation.

The compiled engine file "b4w.min.js" can be copied from the SDK's
"deploy/apps/common" directory and placed in the same directory as the
HTML file.


Loading Scenes in Apps
----------------------

To load a 3D scene you need:

1. Place a "<canvas>" element on a page for rendering.

2. Call the "m_main.init()" function with the created element id to
   initialize the WebGL context after the page is loaded.

3. Call the "m_data.load()" function to load a 3D scene.

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <script src="b4w.min.js"></script>
   <script>
   function hello() {
       var m_main = b4w.require("main");
       var m_data = b4w.require("data");

       var canvas_elem = document.getElementById("canvas_id");
       m_main.init(canvas_elem);
       m_data.load("some_scene.json");
   }
   </script>
   </head>

   <body onload="hello()"><canvas id="canvas_id"></canvas></body>

   </html>

注解: Note that a real app should include error checking, setting up
  the engine before initializing and also a basic system for
  interacting with the user.


Module System
-------------

While the engine gives an app programmer an API in the scale of dozens
of modules, it occupies a single "b4w" namespace. To call a module’s
method import it first with the "b4w.require()" function.

It is possible to register external modules if their names do not
collide with already existing modules. A module can be registered with
a "b4w.register()" call. Check if a module with some name already
exists with a "b4w.module_check()" call.

Example:

   // check if module exists
   if (b4w.module_check("my_module"))
       throw "Failed to register module: my_module";

   // register my_module
   b4w.register("my_module", function(exports, require) {

       // import module "version"
       var m_version = require("version");

       // export print_build_date() from module "my_module"
       exports.print_build_date = function() {
           // exec function date() from module "version"
           console.log("Engine build date: " + m_version.date());
       }
   });

   // import module "my_module"
   var m_my_module = b4w.require("my_module");

   // exec function print_build_date() from module "my_module"
   m_my_module.print_build_date();


Creating Apps Quickly
---------------------

Creating an app from scratch can be a tedious task, especially for
beginners. To address this there is a special add-on for the engine
called "app":

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <script src="b4w.min.js"></script>
   <script>

   var m_app = b4w.require("app");
   var m_data = b4w.require("data");

   m_app.init({
       canvas_container_id: "container_id",
       callback: load_cb
   })

   function load_cb() {
       m_data.load("some_scene.json", loaded_cb);
   }

   function loaded_cb() {
       m_app.enable_camera_controls();
   }

   </script>
   </head>

   <body>
       <div id="container_id" style="width: 350px; height: 200px;"></div>
   </body>

   </html>

In this case the "app" module will create a "<canvas>" element inside
the container with the specified "container_id" id. Then it will
initialize the engine after the page is loaded and will finally
execute the "load_cb()" callback.

Then the some_scene.json scene is loaded similar to the previous
example. The only difference is that after the scene is loaded, the
control system is initialized and camera movement with keyboard and
mouse (or sensor screen) becomes possible.

In case when the "app" module is used, it is necessary to explicitly
specify dimensions of the container element. Otherwise, the created
"<canvas>" element will have zero dimensions.


Resource Conversion
===================

Currently, browsers do not fully support all possible media formats,
so in order to create cross-browser applications (and also for
optimization purposes) we recommend you to use the resource converter.

To support a wider range of platforms, a Python script
(*scripts/converter.py*) for converting the source files into other
formats is included into the distribution.

There are two ways to run this script.

Firstly, you can run it automatically using the project mangement
system. The "Convert Resources" button can be found in the main page
of the Project Manager, in the "Operations" tab at the right side of
the screen.

[图片]

Secondly, you can run the script manually:

   > cd <path_to_sdk>/scripts
   > python3 converter.py [options] resize_textures | convert_dds | convert_media

For MS Windows users:

   cd <path_to_sdk>\scripts
   python converter.py [options] resize_textures | convert_dds | convert_media

注解: To run the scripts the Python 3.x needs to be installed in
  your system.

With the -d parameter you can specify the path to a directory in which
converting will take place.

To exclude some directory from resource conversion, it is enough to
put a file named ".b4w_no_conv" in it. This will not affect conversion
in nested directories.

The **resize_textures** argument is used for decreasing texture
resolution for the **LOW** mode.


Dependencies
------------

Please make sure that you have all converter dependencies installed.
You can do it with the following command:

   > python3 <path_to_sdk>/scripts/converter.py check_dependencies

If some program is not installed, the following message will be
displayed:

*Couldn't find PROGRAM_NAME.*

**Linux**

The list of dependencies is listed in the following table:

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Name                            | Ubuntu 15.04 package            |
+=================================+=================================+
| ImageMagick                     | imagemagick                     |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| NVIDIA Texture Tools            | libnvtt-bin                     |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Libav                           | libav-tools                     |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| FFmpeg                          | ffmpeg                          |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

注解: Linux users can additionally install the package qt-faststart
  which is used to optimize loading media files.

**Windows**

For MS Windows users it is not necessary to install these packages
since they are already present in the SDK.

**Mac OS**

Mac OS users can install the brew package manager first and then
install any missing packages.

Before installing packages, install the libpng and libjpeg libraries
using these commands:

   > brew install libpng
   > brew install libjpeg

Now you can proceed with installing required dependencies:

   > brew install imagemagick
   > brew install --with-theora --with-libvpx --with-fdk-aac ffmpeg

In order to install NVIDIA Texture Tools, clone the repository with
the following command:

   > git clone https://github.com/TriumphLLC/NvidiaTextureTools.git

Now you can build and install the package:

   > cd NvidiaTextureTools
   > ./configure
   > make
   > make install


Data Format
-----------

The conversion is performed as follows:

for audio (convert_media):
   * ogg, oga -> mp4

   * mp3 -> ogg

   * mp4, m4a -> ogg

We recommend to use "ogg" as a base format. In this case the only
conversion required for cross-browser compatibility will be "ogg" to
"mp4". Example of an input file: "file_name.ogg", example of an output
file: "file_name.altconv.mp4".

for video (convert_media):
   * webm -> m4v

   * mp4, m4v -> webm

   * ogg, ogv -> webm

   * webm -> seq

   * mp4, m4v -> seq

   * ogg, ogv -> seq

We recommend to use "WebM" as a base format. In this case the only
conversion required for cross-browser compatibility will be "webm" to
"m4v" ("webm" to "seq" for iPhone). Example of an input file:
"file_name.webm", example of an output file: "file_name.altconv.m4v".

for images (convert_dds):
   * png -> dds

   * jpg -> dds

   * bmp -> dds

   * gif -> dds

Example of an input file: "file_name.jpg", example of an output file:
"file_name.altconv.jpg.dds".

For the purpose of optimizing application performance it's possible to
use "min50" (halved) and "DDS" textures. In order to do this, we need
to pass the following parameters during initialization of the
application:

   exports.init = function() {
       m_app.init({
           // . . .
           assets_dds_available: true,
           assets_min50_available: true,
           // . . .
       });
       // . . .
   }

"DDS" textures require less memory (4 times less for "RGBA" data and 6
times for "RGB" data), but using them has following downsides:

   * "DDS" textures might not work on some devices, especially the
     mobile ones, as not all of them support the
     "WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc" extension;

   * as "DDS" is a lossy compression format, compression artifacts
     might be visible, especially on normal and stencil maps; it is
     recommended to disable compression for such textures.

   [图片]

   An example of the "DDS" compression artifacts, particularly visible
   on the edges of the shadow.

During exporting the scene from Blender to the "JSON" format (but not
the "HTML" format), "DDS" textures will be plugged in automatically,
if they are present.

Textures can be converted to the "DDS" format using the project manger
or the *scripts/converter.py* script described above.

The ".seq" file format is used for sequential video. This is applied
for IE 11 and iPhone because they are currently missing support for
standard video formats for textures. Using dds format for images is
more optimal compared to other formats.

The engine can use files which are manually created by a user if they
have the following names: "file_name.altconv.m4v",
"file_name.altconv.mp3" and so on. Such files should be placed in the
same directory as the media files used in Blender.

You can also use the free and cross-platform application Miro Video
Converter to convert media files.


Code Examples
=============

The SDK includes the Code Snippets application which demonstrates how
to use the engine's functionality.

Currently, this application contains the following examples:

   * Bone API - an example of individual bones position control

   * Camera Animation - procedural camera animation

   * Camera Move Styles - changing control modes for the camera

   * Canvas Texture - working with canvas textures

   * Custom Anchors - creating custom annotations

   * Dynamic Geometry - procedural geometry modification

   * Gyro (Mobile Only) - working with mobile devices' gyroscopes

   * Instancing - copying scene objects in runtime

   * Material API - tweaking material properties and replacing
     objects' materials

   * Morphing - using shape keys

   * Ray Test - the usage of raycasting for obstacles detection

The Code Snippets application is available at
"SDK/apps_dev/code_snippets/code_snippets_dev.html". It can be also
run by using a link in the "index.html" file located in the SDK root.


Event-Driven Model
==================

The event-driven model provides a universal interface for describing
the 3D scene's change of state. It simplifies the processing of
physics events and user actions.


Sensors
-------

The basic unit of the event-driven model is a sensor. A sensor is a
programming entity and can only be active (1, one) or inactive (0,
zero). Some sensors may carry a payload which can be received in the
manifold's callback function with corresponding API. For example, the
ray-tracing sensor (Ray Sensor) provides the relative length of the
intersection ray.

Users cannot directly control sensors via the external API. Instead,
all sensors must be present in one or multiple collections - so called
sensor manifolds. A manifold is a logic container associated with a
scene object. It generates a response to a defined set of sensor
events by executing a callback function. To define the manifold it is
required to have the following information (see also the API
documentation for description of the "controls.create_sensor_manifold"
function):

* An object to carry the manifold (e.g. a thrown object).

* A unique id of the manifold (e.g. "IMPACT").

* Callback execution mode (the options are: "CT_POSITIVE" - logic
  function positive result, "CT_CONTINUOUS" - every frame with a
  positive logic function result and once with a zero result,
  "CT_LEVEL" - any logic, function result change, "CT_SHOT" - one-
  stage logic function result change, "CT_TRIGGER" - logic function
  result switch, "CT_CHANGE" - any sensor value change).

* An array of sensors.

* A logic function to define the combination of the sensor states
  for which the callback function is executed.

* A callback function.

* An optional parameter to pass into the callback function.

You can read more about engine API in the controls module
documentation.


Example
-------

Let's consider the task to insonify the impact of a thrown stone. A
distinctive sound should be produced for impacting different media
(for example terrain and wall). There are collision meshes with
physical materials in the Blender scene, material ids are "TERRAIN"
and "WALL". There is also a physical object being thrown in the scene,
the object is named "Stone".

Let's define a collision sensor for each medium, by the type of the
sound produced.

   // import the modules
   var m_scenes = b4w.require("scenes");
   var m_controls = b4w.require("controls");

   // get the object being thrown
   var stone = m_scenes.get_object_by_name("Stone");

   // create the sensors
   var sensor_impact_terrain = m_controls.create_collision_sensor(stone, "TERRAIN");
   var sensor_impact_wall    = m_controls.create_collision_sensor(stone, "WALL");

Add the sensors into an array. Use the "OR" logic in the logic
function. Place the sound processing code in the callback function.
Create the sensor manifold with the "IMPACT" id and the "CT_SHOT"
type.

   // array of the sensors
   var impact_sens_array = [sensor_impact_terrain, sensor_impact_wall];

   // manifold logic function
   var impact_sens_logic = function(s) {return (s[0] || s[1])};

   // callback
   var impact_cb = function(obj, manifold_id, pulse) {

       // NOTE: it's possible to play both sounds simultaneously

       if (m_controls.get_sensor_value(obj, manifold_id, 0) == 1) {
           // ...
           console.log("play the terrain impact sound");
       }

       if (m_controls.get_sensor_value(obj, manifold_id, 1) == 1) {
           // ...
           console.log("play the wall impact sound");
       }
   }

   // create the manifold
   m_controls.create_sensor_manifold(stone, "IMPACT", m_ctl.CT_SHOT,
       impact_sens_array, impact_sens_logic, impact_cb);

When the "Stone" object collides with any physical material of
"TERRAIN" or "WALL", the callback function is executed. Inside this
function we get the values of both sensors by their indices in the
sensor array (0 - "TERRAIN", 1 - "WALL"). The sensor value = 1
(active) means that the collision happened with the corresponding
physical material. As a result the corresponding sound is produced
(the code is not shown).

Loading Local Resources
=======================

The engine's renderer is a web application and it works when you view
an HTML file in a browser. After initialization the resources (scenes,
textures) are loaded. This process is subject to the same-origin
policy rule. In particular this rule forbids loading from a local
directory.

Since version 15.02, the Blend4Web SDK includes the development server
to solve the problem of loading local resources.


Quality Profiles
================

Several quality profiles are implemented in order to support platforms
with different functionality.

   * *low quality* ("P_LOW") - a range of functions is turned off
     (such as shadows, dynamic reflection, postprocessing), the size
     of textures is halved when using a release version, anti-aliasing
     is disabled

   * *high quality* ("P_HIGH") - all features requested by the scene
     are used, the anti-aliasing method is FXAA

   * *maximum quality* ("P_ULTRA") - rendering resolution is
     doubled, resolution of shadow maps is increased, the anti-
     aliasing method is FXAA (uses higher quality settings and works
     slower).

   * *custom quality* ("P_CUSTOM") - any quality parameter can be
     set to any possible value. This option is used when you need to
     set certain quality parameters manually. By default, it uses the
     same settings as "High" quality profile.

Switching the quality profiles can be performed in runtime before
initialization of the WebGL context. The default profile is "P_HIGH".

   var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
   var m_main = b4w.require("main");

   m_cfg.set("quality", m_cfg.P_LOW);
   m_main.init(...);

Application developers can also set the **quality** parameter upon
engine initialization using the "app.js" add-on:

   var m_cfg = b4w.require("config");
   var m_app = b4w.require("app");

   m_app.init({
       canvas_container_id: "body_id",
       quality: m_cfg.P_HIGH
   });


Non-FullScreen Web Apps
=======================

The Canvas element, to which the rendering is performed, can change
its position relative to the browser window. This can occur due to
some manipulations over the DOM tree, or as a result of page scrolling
which is especially relevant for non-fullscreen web applications.

In most cases this will not affect the performance of the app by any
means. However, some DOM events related to mouse cursor or touch
position may carry incorrect information. This occurs because the
coordinates obtained from the corresponding events are measured
relative to the origin of the browser window, while the engine works
with the coordinate space of the Canvas element itself (its origin is
located in the top left corner).

1. If the top left corner of the Canvas element matches the top
   left corner of the browser window and is fixed in its position
   (non- movable) then it's sufficient to use event.clientX and
   event.clientY coordinates of the input events or
   get_coords_x()/get_coords_y() methods.

   var m_mouse   = require("mouse");

   // . . .
   var x = event.clientX;
   var y = event.clientY;
   // . . .
   var x = m_mouse.get_coords_x(event);
   var y = m_mouse.get_coords_y(event);
   // . . .

2. In the case of the scrolled browser window, you have to use
   event.pageX and event.pageY coordinates.

   // . . .
   var x = event.pageX;
   var y = event.pageY;
   // . . .

3. In the case of more sophisticated manipulations with the Canvas
   element (scrolling of the page elements, displacement from the top
   level corner of the browser window, changes in the DOM-tree) you
   need to perform correct coordinate conversions. In order to obtain
   coordinates suitable for use in the engine, you can covert them by
   using the "client_to_canvas_coords()" method of the "container"
   module:

   var m_cont   = require("container");
   var _vec2_tmp = new Float32Array(2);
   // . . .
   var canvas_xy = m_cont.client_to_canvas_coords(event.clientX, event.clientY, _vec2_tmp);
   // . . .



   In order to obtain coordinates in the Canvas space, the engine
   should know its position relative to the browser window. However,
   if this position is subjected to changes during the work of the app
   (due to scrolling for example), the Canvas position should be
   recalculated. To do this automatically, you can set the
   "track_container_position" property upon app initialization:

   exports.init = function() {
       m_app.init({
           // . . .
           track_container_position: true,
           // . . .
       });
       // . . .
   }



   Please note, that this setting can lead to performance degradation
   in some browsers (such as Firefox) due to frequent DOM tree
   accesses. If the performance is critical, you can update the Canvas
   position manually when it is really necessary. To do this, use the
   "force_offsets_updating()" and "update_canvas_offsets()" methods
   instead of the "track_container_position" setting, or even the
   lower-level "set_canvas_offsets()" method from the "container"
   module:

   var m_cont = require("container");
   // . . .
   m_cont.force_offsets_updating();
   // . . .
   m_cont.update_canvas_offsets();
   // . . .
   m_cont.set_canvas_offsets(offset_left, offset_top);
   // . . .



4. The possibility to scale the whole webpage can lead to Canvas
   element displacement on mobile devices. The described decisions are
   suitable in this case. However, you can lock scaling at all and
   thus avoid such problems. It is enough to add the following meta-
   tag to the page's header:

   <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no">
